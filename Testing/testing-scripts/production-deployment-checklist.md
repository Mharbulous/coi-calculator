## Deployment Steps

### Code Preparation
- [ ] Remove any console.log statements not needed in production
- [ ] Ensure test cards and development keys are not in production code
- [ ] Update version numbers if applicable
- [ ] Run final validation tests on staging environment

### Backup
- [ ] Create backup of current production environment
- [ ] Document rollback procedure in case of issues

### Deployment
- [ ] Deploy application code to production server
- [ ] Deploy serverless functions to Netlify/Vercel
- [ ] Verify all assets are properly deployed and accessible
- [ ] Check all file paths and URLs are correct for production

### Post-Deployment Verification
- [ ] Perform complete end-to-end testing in production
- [ ] Verify Stripe integration works in production
- [ ] Check that firebase data is loading properly
- [ ] Test demo mode and payment flow with real cards
- [ ] Verify application performance in production

## Analytics and Monitoring

- [ ] Set up analytics to track conversion rates
- [ ] Configure monitoring for serverless functions
- [ ] Set up alerts for payment failures or errors
- [ ] Implement logging for debugging production issues

## Documentation and Support

- [ ] Update user documentation with payment information
- [ ] Prepare support documentation for users with payment issues
- [ ] Document the deployment process for future reference
- [ ] Add instructions for handling refund requests

## Security Review

- [ ] Ensure payment data is handled securely
- [ ] Verify no sensitive keys or tokens are exposed in client-side code
- [ ] Check that Firebase security rules are properly configured
- [ ] Review API endpoints for potential security issues

## Rollback Plan

1. **Identify Issue**: Determine the specific problem that requires rollback.
2. **Decision Point**: Decide if a full rollback is needed or if a hotfix can address the issue.
3. **Restore Backup**: If full rollback is needed, restore from the backup created before deployment.
4. **Revert Code**: Use git revert or restore from previous release.
5. **Revert Functions**: Roll back serverless functions to previous versions.
6. **Revert Environment Variables**: Reset any changed environment variables to previous values.
7. **Verify Rollback**: Test that the rollback restored functionality properly.
8. **Notify Users**: Communicate any downtime or issues to users.
9. **Document Issue**: Document what happened for future reference.

## Final Approval

- [ ] Product owner approval obtained
- [ ] Technical lead approval obtained
- [ ] All critical tests passed
- [ ] Go/No-Go decision made and documented
