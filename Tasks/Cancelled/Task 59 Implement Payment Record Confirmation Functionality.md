# Task 59 Implement Payment Record Confirmation Functionality

## Background

Our application currently calculates interest in a table format similar to the "Before" version shown in pay\_table.md. We have implemented a "Record Payment" wireframe modal that allows users to enter payment details (amount and payment date), but the confirmation button currently has no functionality.

## Objective

Implement the functionality for the "Confirm" button in the Record Payment modal that processes the payment entry, modifies the interest table, and properly applies the payment to interest first and then principal, following the exact pattern demonstrated in pay\_table.md.

## Requirements

### 1\. Payment Processing Logic

*   When a user confirms a payment, the application must:
    *   Capture the payment amount and date from the modal form
    *   Calculate the total accumulated interest up to the payment date
    *   Apply the payment first to accumulated interest, then to principal
    *   Calculate the new principal balance for subsequent interest calculations
    *   Insert a payment record row in the appropriate position in the table

### 2\. Interest Table Modification

*   For payments within an interest period:
    *   Split the period into two segments (before and after payment)
    *   Calculate interest for each segment separately
    *   Use the original principal for the first segment
    *   Use the reduced principal for the second segment and all subsequent periods

### 3\. Edge Case Handling

*   For payments on period boundary dates (first or last day of a period):
    *   No need to split interest calculation rows
    *   For payments on the last day of a period:
        *   Place the payment row after the completed interest period
        *   Apply the reduced principal to the next period
    *   For payments on the first day of a period:
        *   Place the payment row before the interest period
        *   Apply the reduced principal to the current and all subsequent periods

### 4\. UI Updates

*   After processing the payment:
    *   Redraw the interest table with the new payment row and updated calculations
    *   Close the modal
    *   Provide visual confirmation of successful payment recording

### 5\. Input Validation

*   Implement validation to prevent:
    *   Invalid payment dates (must be within range of interest periods)
    *   Invalid payment amounts (must be positive numbers)
    *   Display appropriate error messages for validation failures

## Expected Behavior

The implementation should exactly follow the pattern shown in pay\_table.md where a $500 payment on 2022-03-20 is properly applied by:

1.  First covering $378.64 in accumulated interest
2.  Then applying $121.36 toward principal reduction
3.  Reducing the principal from $10,540.50 to $10,419.14
4.  Calculating all subsequent interest based on the reduced principal

## Technical Considerations

*   Integration with existing interest calculation logic
*   Proper handling of dates and currency amounts
*   State management for updating the table data
*   DOM manipulation for refreshing the table display

## Success Criteria

*   The payment record functionality accurately implements the rules illustrated in pay\_table.md
*   All edge cases are properly handled
*   The UI remains intuitive and responsive
*   The table calculations remain accurate after multiple payment entries
