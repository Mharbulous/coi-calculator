# Task 4.4: Set Up Payment Processor Integration

## Overview
This task focuses on integrating a third-party payment processor (such as Stripe or PayPal) with the Court Order Interest Calculator. This integration will enable secure payment processing while keeping sensitive payment data off of our servers.

## Complexity
Simple

## Estimated Time
30 minutes

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Select a Payment Processor
1. Evaluate payment processor options:
   - Stripe (recommended for developer-friendly API)
   - PayPal (good for customers who prefer PayPal accounts)
   - Square (alternative option)
2. Consider factors like:
   - Fee structure
   - API simplicity
   - SDK availability for JavaScript
   - Security features
   - Supported payment methods

### 2. Set Up Developer Account
1. Register for a developer account with the chosen processor
2. Create a test environment/sandbox account
3. Generate API keys (test keys initially)
4. Configure webhook endpoints if needed
5. Document all credentials securely

### 3. Install SDK and Configure
1. Add the payment processor's JavaScript SDK:
   - Include via npm if using a build system
   - Or include via CDN link in HTML
2. Create a configuration module:
   - Store API keys (use environment variables or Firebase config)
   - Initialize the SDK with appropriate settings
   - Set up test mode for development

### 4. Implement Client-Side Integration
1. Create a payment service module:
   - Function to initialize payment form elements
   - Function to create payment intent/order
   - Function to submit payment details to processor
   - Function to handle payment responses
2. Connect to the payment form created in Task 4.3

### 5. Implement Server-Side Components (Firebase Functions)
1. Create Firebase cloud function(s) for payment operations:
   - Create payment intent/session
   - Verify payment completion
   - Connect payment to user account
   - Generate access tokens upon successful payment
2. Set up secure environment for API keys in Firebase

### 6. Set Up Payment Webhook Handling
1. Create webhook endpoint for payment status updates:
   - Set up callback URL in Firebase Functions
   - Implement verification of webhook signatures
   - Add logic to update user access status based on events
   - Handle various payment status updates (success, failure, refund)

## Testing Procedures
- Test payment flow using test cards/accounts
- Verify successful payments grant application access
- Test various failure scenarios (insufficient funds, expired card)
- Ensure webhook events are properly processed
- Verify test mode doesn't affect production data

## Expected Outcome
1. Functional integration with the chosen payment processor
2. Secure handling of payment information
3. Proper granting of access upon successful payment
4. Complete test suite for payment scenarios

## Notes
- Never store credit card details in your database
- Use the payment processor's recommended security practices
- Implement proper error handling for failed payments
- Consider implementing both immediate purchase and subscription options
- Ensure the integration complies with PCI DSS requirements
- Keep test and production environments strictly separated
- Document the integration process for future developers
