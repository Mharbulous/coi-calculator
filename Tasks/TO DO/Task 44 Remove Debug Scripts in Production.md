# Task 44: Remove Debug Scripts in Production

## Problem Statement
The application currently includes several debugging and testing scripts that are loaded regardless of the environment (development or production). These scripts add unnecessary overhead in production, potentially affecting performance and exposing implementation details that aren't needed for end users.

## Current Implementation
The application includes debug scripts directly in the HTML:

```html
<!-- Debug script for page card positions -->
<script src="debug-page-card-positions.js"></script>

<!-- Test script for ResizeObserver-based pagination -->
<script src="dom/pageBreaks/test-observer.js"></script>
```

Additionally, there are debug-specific resources scattered throughout the codebase:
- Debug visual indicators in the pagination system
- Debug console logs that output detailed information
- The `debug-visuals.js` file which may contain development-only visualizations

## Proposed Solution
Implement a mechanism to conditionally include or exclude debug-related scripts and features based on the environment (development vs. production). This will ensure that production builds are optimized for performance and don't expose unnecessary implementation details.

### Key Components

1. **Environment Detection**
   - Create a simple way to determine whether the application is running in development or production mode
   - This could be a build-time configuration or runtime detection

2. **Debug Script Management**
   - Modify HTML templates to conditionally include debug scripts
   - Create a build step that removes debug scripts for production builds

3. **Debug Visual Elements**
   - Ensure debug visual indicators (like page boundary markers) are only shown in development
   - Consolidate debug visualization code to make it easier to manage

4. **Console Logging**
   - Implement different logging levels (debug, info, warn, error)
   - Ensure detailed debug logs are suppressed in production

## Benefits
- **Improved Performance**: Reduces unnecessary script loading and execution in production
- **Cleaner UX**: Eliminates visual debugging elements for end users
- **Smaller Payload**: Reduces the overall download size for production users
- **Enhanced Security**: Minimizes exposure of implementation details
- **Improved Maintainability**: Creates a clear separation between development and production code

## Implementation Approach
This task should be implemented with a focus on creating a simple, maintainable solution that doesn't over-complicate the codebase. Rather than implementing a full-featured build system, a lightweight approach is preferred:

1. Define a simple mechanism to distinguish between development and production
2. Create a small utility for conditional script loading or a basic build script
3. Consolidate debugging code to make it easier to control
4. Document the approach for future maintenance

## Testing Considerations
- Verify the application functions correctly in production mode without debug scripts
- Confirm debug features are still accessible in development mode
- Ensure the environment detection works reliably

## Future Considerations
While this task focuses on a simple solution for debug scripts, it lays groundwork for more comprehensive environment-specific builds in the future, which could include:
- Asset minification
- Dead code elimination
- More sophisticated feature toggling
