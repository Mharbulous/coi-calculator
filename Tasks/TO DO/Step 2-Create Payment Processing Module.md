# Step 2: Create Payment Processing Module

## Overview
The Payment Processing Module handles the interaction with payment gateways and manages the payment flow. It provides an abstraction layer over the payment provider's API and communicates with the Access Control Module to store payment data.

## Implementation Details

### Create a New File
Create a new JavaScript module file named `payment-processor.js` in the BC COIA calculator directory.

### Module Functionality
The module should export an object with the following functionality:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Configure the payment processor with options
   - Load the appropriate payment provider's script (Stripe, PayPal, etc.)
   - Set up test mode for development

2. **Payment Processing**:
   - Handle payment submission
   - Communicate with the payment provider's API
   - Process the payment response
   - Store payment data via the Access Control Module

3. **Payment Status**:
   - Check and return the current payment status
   - Provide information about expiration dates
   - Handle expired payments

### Payment Provider Integration
The module should support at least one payment provider initially, with the ability to add more:
- Stripe integration (recommended for its simplicity)
- PayPal as an alternative option
- Structure the code to make adding new providers easy

### Dynamic Script Loading
Implement dynamic loading of payment provider scripts to:
- Reduce initial page load time
- Only load what's needed based on configuration
- Avoid loading payment scripts for users who have already paid

### Error Handling
Include robust error handling for:
- Failed payments
- Network issues
- Invalid payment details
- Payment provider API errors

## Integration Points
- The module will be imported by the Payment UI module
- It will use the Access Control Module to store payment data
- It will be initialized during application startup

## Testing Considerations
- Include a test mode that simulates successful payments
- Provide a way to simulate failed payments for testing error handling
- Consider adding logging for debugging payment issues
