# Task 32.2: Make Prejudgment Interest Amount Editable When Checkbox is Unchecked

*This is part of [Task 32: Enhance Prejudgment Interest Checkbox Behavior](./32_Enhance_Prejudgment_Interest_Checkbox_Behavior.md)*

## Current Behavior

Currently, when the "Calculate prejudgment interest" checkbox is unchecked:
- The prejudgment interest amount in the summary table shows $0.00
- This amount is not editable - it's displayed as static text
- The calculation is not performed, so the value is always zero
- If the user wants to include a prejudgment interest amount, they must check the checkbox and use the calculated value

This behavior limits flexibility for users who want to specify a custom prejudgment interest amount without using the built-in calculation.

## Required Changes

1. Modify the `updateSummaryTable` function in `tables.summary.js` to:
   - Make the prejudgment interest amount field editable when the "Calculate prejudgment interest" checkbox is unchecked
   - Keep it as display-only (non-editable) when the checkbox is checked
   - Initialize the editable field with the previously calculated value when switching from checked to unchecked
   - Use the user-entered value in the total calculation when the checkbox is unchecked

2. Update the `recalculate` function in `calculator.core.js` to:
   - Use the user-entered prejudgment interest value when the checkbox is unchecked
   - Use the calculated value when the checkbox is checked

3. Add a new template or modify existing templates in the HTML to support an editable amount field for prejudgment interest.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Modify `updateSummaryTable` in `tables.summary.js`

The function needs to be updated to handle the prejudgment interest amount field differently based on the checkbox state:

- When the checkbox is checked:
  - Use the existing template that displays the calculated amount as static text
  - Use the calculated value from the state

- When the checkbox is unchecked:
  - Use a template that includes an editable input field for the amount
  - Initialize the field with the last calculated value when switching from checked to unchecked
  - Add event listeners to update the state when the user changes the value

This will require:
- Creating or identifying an appropriate template for the editable amount field
- Adding logic to select the correct template based on the checkbox state
- Adding event listeners to handle changes to the editable field

### 2. Update `recalculate` in `calculator.core.js`

The `recalculate` function needs to be updated to handle the prejudgment interest amount differently based on the checkbox state:

- When the checkbox is checked:
  - Calculate the prejudgment interest as usual
  - Update the state with the calculated value

- When the checkbox is unchecked:
  - Skip the prejudgment interest calculation
  - Use the user-entered value from the state in the total calculation
  - Ensure the user-entered value is preserved when toggling the checkbox

### 3. HTML Template Changes

We need to ensure there's an appropriate template for the editable prejudgment interest amount field. This might involve:

- Creating a new template specifically for this purpose
- Modifying an existing template to support this use case
- Ensuring the template includes the necessary structure for an editable currency input field

## Expected Outcome

After implementing these changes:

- When the "Calculate prejudgment interest" checkbox is checked:
  - The prejudgment interest amount will be calculated based on the dates and amounts entered
  - The amount will be displayed as static text (non-editable)
  - The calculation table will be visible

- When the "Calculate prejudgment interest" checkbox is unchecked:
  - The prejudgment interest amount will be editable
  - The field will be initialized with the last calculated value when switching from checked to unchecked
  - The user can enter any amount they want
  - The calculation table will be hidden
  - The date field will be hidden (as implemented in Task 32.1)

- When switching between checked and unchecked:
  - The values will be preserved appropriately
  - The total will be updated to reflect the current state

This will provide users with more flexibility in specifying prejudgment interest amounts, allowing them to either use the built-in calculation or enter a custom amount.
