# Task: 12.3 Zustand Refactor - Phase 3: Cleanup & Final Verification

**Goal:** Remove the old `appState` object and perform final verification tests after all functionality has been migrated to Zustand.

**Depends On:** Task 12.2 (Incremental Integration)

**Steps:**

1.  **Confirm Full Migration:**
    *   Review the codebase (`calculator.js`, `domUtils.js`, and any other relevant files) to ensure there are no remaining reads from or writes to the global `appState` object.
    *   Confirm that all state management logic now uses the Zustand store (`useStore.getState()` for reads/actions, `useStore.subscribe()` for reactivity).
2.  **Remove `appState` Object:**
    *   Carefully delete the `appState` object definition from `BC COIA calculator/calculator.js`.
3.  **Final Browser Testing:**
    *   Load `index.html` in the browser.
    *   Perform a thorough test of *all* application features:
        *   Inputting data in all fields.
        *   Triggering calculations.
        *   Adding/removing special damages.
        *   Checking all displayed outputs.
        *   Testing edge cases (e.g., invalid dates, zero amounts).
    *   Monitor the browser's developer console for any errors during testing.
4.  **Final Jest Testing:**
    *   Run the full Jest test suite (`npm test` or equivalent).
    *   Ensure all tests, including the `store.test.js` tests and any other application tests, are passing.
5.  **Code Review (Optional):**
    *   Review the changes made during the refactoring process for clarity, consistency, and potential improvements.

**Completion:** Once all steps are complete and verified, the refactoring to Zustand is finished. The original Task 12 can be considered done.
