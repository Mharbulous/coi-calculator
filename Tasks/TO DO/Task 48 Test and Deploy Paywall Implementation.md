# Task 48: Test and Deploy Paywall Implementation

## Objective
Test all components of the paywall implementation and deploy the complete solution to production.

## Estimated Time
1-2 hours

## Prerequisites
- All previous paywall tasks completed (Tasks 44-47)
- Access to testing environment
- Deployment access to production server

## Tasks

### 1. Test Demo Mode
- Verify the demo mode banner displays correctly
- Confirm watermark appears on calculation results
- Check that mock data is being used when in demo mode
- Ensure all application features work correctly in demo mode

### 2. Test Payment Flow
- Verify the "Get Accurate Results" button appears and is styled correctly
- Test the entire payment flow using Stripe test cards
- Confirm the success page correctly processes the session_id
- Verify the verification token is stored properly in localStorage

### 3. Test Data Switching
- Verify the application correctly switches to real data after payment
- Confirm the demo mode banner disappears after payment
- Ensure calculations are accurate with real data
- Test persistence of payment status across page refreshes

### 4. Deploy to Production
- Deploy the application code to the production server
- Configure Stripe webhook endpoints in production
- Deploy serverless functions to Netlify/Vercel
- Set up environment variables in production

### 5. Final Verification
- Perform end-to-end testing in the production environment
- Verify Stripe integration works in production
- Test cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Test on mobile devices to ensure responsive design

## Implementation Details

### Test Cards for Stripe
```
Test Card Numbers:
- Successful payment: 4242 4242 4242 4242
- Failed payment: 4000 0000 0000 0002

Expiration Date: Any future date
CVC: Any 3 digits
Postal Code: Any 5 digits
```

### Deployment Checklist
```
1. Code changes:
   - All UI elements for demo mode
   - Mock interest rate data implementation
   - Payment button and Stripe integration
   - Success and cancel pages

2. Serverless functions:
   - Verify payment function
   - Create checkout session function

3. Environment variables:
   - Stripe publishable key
   - Stripe secret key
   - Redirect URLs

4. Configuration:
   - Netlify/Vercel redirects
   - CORS configuration
   - Webhook endpoints
```

### Testing Script
```javascript
// Test localStorage persistence
function testPaymentPersistence() {
  // Clear existing data
  localStorage.removeItem('payment_verified');
  localStorage.removeItem('payment_timestamp');
  
  // Set mock payment data
  localStorage.setItem('payment_verified', 'test_token_123');
  localStorage.setItem('payment_timestamp', Date.now().toString());
  
  // Reload page
  location.reload();
  
  // After reload, check if data is correctly retrieved and used
  // (This will need to be verified manually in the console)
}
```

## Acceptance Criteria
- Demo mode functions correctly with mock data
- Payment flow works end-to-end with Stripe Checkout
- Verification token is correctly stored and retrieved
- Application switches between mock and real data based on payment status
- All features are fully functional in both demo and paid modes
- Deployment to production is successful and stable
- No console errors or warnings in production

## Notes
- Document the testing process for future reference
- Create backup of the production environment before deployment
- Consider implementing analytics to track conversion rates
- Prepare support documentation for users who experience payment issues
