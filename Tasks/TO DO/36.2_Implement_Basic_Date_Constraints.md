# Task 36.2: Implement Basic Date Constraints for Special Damages

## Objective
Enhance the special damages flatpickr implementation to enforce proper date constraints.

## Requirements
1. Modify the special damages flatpickr initialization function to apply appropriate date constraints
2. Ensure special damages dates can only be selected between:
   - Earliest: One day after the Prejudgment Interest Date
   - Latest: The Judgment Date
3. Add error handling and visual feedback consistent with other date pickers

## Implementation Details

### 1. Add Date Constraint Logic
- Modify `initializeSpecialDamagesDatePicker` to:
  - Retrieve current Prejudgment Interest Date and Judgment Date from the store
  - Calculate "day after Prejudgment Interest Date" as min date
  - Use Judgment Date as max date
  - Apply these constraints to the flatpickr configuration

### 2. Add Validation Logic
- Add onChange handler that:
  - Validates selected date against constraints
  - Rejects and clears invalid dates
  - Updates input background color for visual feedback (use existing ERROR_BACKGROUND_COLOR and NORMAL_BACKGROUND_COLOR constants)
  - Updates store with valid date selection

### 3. Edge Case Handling
- Handle cases where Prejudgment Interest Date or Judgment Date is not set
- Handle case where the constraints create an impossible date range
- Provide appropriate user feedback in these scenarios

## Acceptance Criteria
- Special damages date picker enforces the required constraints:
  - Cannot select dates before one day after Prejudgment Interest Date
  - Cannot select dates after Judgment Date
- Visual feedback (background color changes) alerts user to invalid dates
- Valid dates are properly saved and trigger recalculation

## Test Approach
For manual testing:
1. Create a special damages row
2. Initialize the date picker with the new function
3. Verify that dates outside the constraints cannot be selected
4. Verify that visual feedback is provided for invalid dates
5. Verify that valid dates are properly saved and trigger recalculation
