# Task 33.3: Implement State Preservation for Prejudgment Date

## Current Issue

When toggling the "Calculate prejudgment interest" checkbox off and then back on, the prejudgment date is lost because the current implementation only saves the calculation results, not the prejudgment date itself.

## Objective

Modify the `savePrejudgmentState()` function in `store.js` to save the prejudgment date along with the calculation results when toggling the prejudgment checkbox off.

## Implementation Steps

1. Open `BC COIA calculator/store.js`

2. Modify the `savePrejudgmentState()` function to save the prejudgment date:

```javascript
/**
 * Saves the current prejudgment calculation state
 * Used when toggling the prejudgment checkbox off
 */
savePrejudgmentState: () => set((state) => ({
    savedPrejudgmentState: {
        prejudgmentStartDate: state.inputs.prejudgmentStartDate, // Save the prejudgment date
        specialDamages: [...state.results.specialDamages],
        prejudgmentResult: {
            ...state.results.prejudgmentResult
        }
    }
})),
```

## Key Changes

1. Added saving of prejudgment date:
   - Added new property `prejudgmentStartDate` to the `savedPrejudgmentState` object
   - Stores the current prejudgment date from `state.inputs.prejudgmentStartDate`

## Testing Procedure

1. Complete and verify Tasks 33.1 and 33.2 first
2. Open the application in your browser using Live Server
3. Open the browser's developer console (F12 or right-click > Inspect > Console)
4. Enter a valid prejudgment interest date (e.g., "2024-04-20")
5. Perform the following tests:
   - Open the console and add a console log statement before the `return` in `savePrejudgmentState()` to verify the date is being saved:
     ```javascript
     console.log("Saving prejudgment state with date:", state.inputs.prejudgmentStartDate);
     ```
   - Uncheck the "Calculate prejudgment interest" checkbox
   - Check the console to verify the prejudgment date was saved
   - You can also use browser dev tools to inspect the Zustand store state and verify the date is in `savedPrejudgmentState`

## Expected Results

- When the prejudgment checkbox is unchecked, the prejudgment date is correctly saved in the `savedPrejudgmentState` object
- The saved date should be in the same format as it was originally stored (Date object)
- Console logs should confirm the date is being saved

## Dependencies

- This task builds on Tasks 33.1 and 33.2
- This task is required for Task 33.4 (State Restoration)
