# Task 1.6: Configure Basic Security Rules

## Overview
This subtask involves configuring basic security rules for the Firestore database to control access to the interest rates data. Proper security rules are essential even during development to ensure data integrity and prevent unauthorized access.

## Complexity
Simple

## Estimated Time
15 minutes

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Access Firebase Security Rules
1. In the Firebase Console, navigate to Firestore Database
2. Select the "Rules" tab to access the security rules editor

### 2. Configure Read-Only Access to Interest Rates
1. Update the security rules to allow read-only access to the interest rates collection:
   ```
   rules_version = '2';
   service cloud.firestore {
     match /databases/{database}/documents {
       // Allow read access to rates for testing
       match /interestRates/{document=**} {
         allow read: true;         // Allow anyone to read
         allow write: if false;    // No write access from client
       }
       
       // Default deny for all other collections
       match /{document=**} {
         allow read, write: if false;
       }
     }
   }
   ```

### 3. Document the Security Rules
1. Take a screenshot or copy the final rules for documentation
2. Note any specific decisions made regarding security settings
3. Add this information to your project documentation

### 4. Plan for Future Security Enhancements
1. Document future security rule updates to implement in Task 5:
   - Authentication-based access
   - Role-based permissions
   - Rate limiting
   - Request validation

## Testing Steps
1. Verify the rules are properly saved in the Firebase Console
2. Test read access to the interestRates collection using the test script from Task 1.5
3. Attempt a write operation to verify it's blocked (can be done in the Firebase Console)

## Expected Outcome
By the end of this subtask, you should have:
1. Basic security rules configured for the Firestore database
2. Read-only access to the interestRates collection
3. Write protection for all collections
4. Documentation of the security configuration

## Notes
- These are development/testing rules, not production rules
- More comprehensive security rules will be implemented in Task 5
- Security rules are a critical component of a Firebase application
- Even for development, it's important to have some level of protection
