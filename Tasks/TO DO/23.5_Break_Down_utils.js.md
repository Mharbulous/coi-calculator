# Task 23.5: Break Down utils.js

## Objective
Break down the `BC COIA calculator/utils.js` file (currently 316 lines) into smaller, more focused utility files, each around 200 lines.

## Background
`utils.js` contains various utility functions for date and currency manipulation. Separating these into distinct files based on their domain (date vs. currency) will improve code organization and make it easier to find relevant helper functions.

## File to Break Down
- `BC COIA calculator/utils.js` (316 lines)

## Proposed New Files

Split into 2 files:
- **`BC COIA calculator/utils.date.js`** (~200 lines)
  - Contains all date-related utility functions:
    - `normalizeDate`
    - `datesEqual`
    - `dateBefore`
    - `dateAfter`
    - `dateOnOrBefore`
    - `dateOnOrAfter`
    - `validateDateFormat`
    - `parseDateInput`
    - `formatDateForDisplay`
    - `formatDateForInput`
    - `formatDateLong`
    - `daysBetween`
    - `isLeap`
    - `daysInYear`
  - Export all these functions.

- **`BC COIA calculator/utils.currency.js`** (~200 lines)
  - Contains all currency-related utility functions:
    - `parseCurrency`
    - `currencyFormatter` (internal constant)
    - `formatCurrencyForInput`
    - `formatCurrencyForInputWithCommas`
    - `formatCurrencyForDisplay`
  - Export the public functions (`parseCurrency`, `formatCurrencyForInput`, `formatCurrencyForInputWithCommas`, `formatCurrencyForDisplay`).

## Implementation Strategy

1. Create the new files: `utils.date.js`, `utils.currency.js`.
2. Move the date-related functions listed above into `utils.date.js`. Add necessary `export` statements for each function.
3. Move the currency-related functions listed above into `utils.currency.js`. Add necessary `export` statements for the public functions.
4. Update all files that previously imported functions from `utils.js` to import them from the specific new files (`utils.date.js` or `utils.currency.js`). This will likely include files like `calculations.js`, `calculator.core.js`, `calculator.ui.js`, `dom/` modules, and test files.
5. Test the application thoroughly, paying close attention to date inputs/display and currency formatting/calculations. Check for console errors.
6. Ensure all relevant unit tests (specifically those in `utils.test.js`, which will be addressed in Task 23.6) are updated to import from the new files and still pass.
7. After confirming tests pass and the application works correctly, delete the original `utils.js` file.

## Acceptance Criteria

- `utils.js` is removed.
- `utils.date.js` and `utils.currency.js` are created.
- `utils.date.js` contains only date-related utility functions.
- `utils.currency.js` contains only currency-related utility functions.
- Each new file is around 200 lines.
- All necessary functions are exported from the new files.
- Imports in other modules are updated correctly.
- The application's date and currency handling works as before.
- No console errors related to the refactoring.
- All associated unit tests pass after being updated (Task 23.6).
