# Task 30.1: Refactor Interest Rates End Dates

## Description

Currently, `interestRates.js` stores information about Court Order Interest Rates, including start and end dates for the different rates that have been in effect historically. However, storing both start and end dates creates the potential for gaps in our date coverage, which could break the application since the calculation code assumes there are no gaps.

This task involves refactoring the interest rates data structure to remove end dates and instead calculate the end of one interest rate period by looking at the start date of the next interest rate period.

## Objectives

1. Modify `interestRates.js` to:
   - Remove end dates from the interest rate periods
   - Add a `lastUpdated` date to track when the file was last updated
   - Export the `lastUpdated` date for use in calculations

2. Refactor any calculations in the code that rely on end dates from interest rate periods, particularly:
   - Update `getInterestRateForDate` function in `calculations.js`
   - Update `getApplicableRatePeriods` function in `calculations.js`
   - Any other functions that may be using the end dates

## Technical Details

### Current Structure

```javascript
// Current structure in interestRates.js
const rates = {
    BC: [
        { start: "1993-01-01", end: "1993-06-30", prejudgment: 5.25, postjudgment: 7.25 },
        { start: "1993-07-01", end: "1993-12-31", prejudgment: 4.00, postjudgment: 6.00 },
        // ...
    ]
}
```

### Proposed Structure

```javascript
// Proposed structure in interestRates.js
const lastUpdated = parseUTCDate("2025-04-19");

const rates = {
    BC: [
        { start: "1993-01-01", prejudgment: 5.25, postjudgment: 7.25 },
        { start: "1993-07-01", prejudgment: 4.00, postjudgment: 6.00 },
        // ...
    ]
}

// Export both the rates and the lastUpdated date
export { processedRates as default, lastUpdated };
```

### Calculation Logic Changes

The calculation logic will need to be updated to:

1. Determine the end date of a rate period by looking at the start date of the next period
2. For the most recent rate period, use the `lastUpdated` date as the effective end date
3. Ensure no gaps exist in the date coverage

## Rationale

- **Simplification**: Removing end dates simplifies the data structure and reduces redundancy
- **Error Prevention**: Eliminates the possibility of gaps in date coverage
- **Maintainability**: Makes it easier to add new rate periods in the future (only need to specify start date)
- **Data Integrity**: Adding a `lastUpdated` date provides clarity on how current the rates are

## Testing Considerations

- Ensure all existing tests pass after the refactoring
- Add tests to verify that rate calculations work correctly at period boundaries
- Test edge cases, particularly around the most recent rate period and the `lastUpdated` date

## Implementation Notes

- The `processedRates` object will need to be modified to calculate end dates dynamically
- Functions that rely on end dates will need to be updated to use the new approach
- Special care should be taken to maintain backward compatibility with existing code

## Git Commit Message

```
refactor(interestRates): remove end dates from rate periods

- Remove end dates from interest rate periods in interestRates.js
- Add lastUpdated date to track file currency
- Update calculation logic to determine period end dates dynamically
- Ensure no gaps in date coverage for interest calculations

This change simplifies the data structure and prevents potential gaps
in date coverage that could cause calculation errors.
