# Step 3: Create UI Components for Payment

## Overview
The Payment UI module provides the user interface for the payment process. It creates and manages the payment screen, handles user interactions, and communicates with the Payment Processor module to process payments.

## Implementation Details

### Create a New File
Create a new JavaScript module file named `payment-ui.js` in the BC COIA calculator directory.

### Module Functionality
The module should export an object with the following functionality:

1. **UI Initialization**:
   - Create the payment screen elements
   - Set up event listeners
   - Prepare the UI for payment processing

2. **Payment Screen Management**:
   - Show/hide the payment screen
   - Toggle between payment screen and calculator
   - Handle transitions and animations

3. **Form Handling**:
   - Collect payment information
   - Validate form inputs
   - Submit payment data to the Payment Processor
   - Display loading states during processing

4. **Response Handling**:
   - Show success messages after successful payment
   - Display error messages for failed payments
   - Provide clear next steps for users

### UI Components to Create
The payment screen should include:
- Header with application name
- Payment description
- Pricing information
- Email input field (for receipt and future authentication)
- Payment form fields (card number, expiry, CVC)
- Submit button with clear call to action
- Terms and conditions link
- Security indicators (e.g., "Secure payment by Stripe")

### Success and Error States
Implement clear visual feedback for:
- Form validation errors
- Payment processing state
- Successful payment confirmation
- Payment failure with recovery options

### Event Communication
Use custom events to communicate with other modules:
- Dispatch a 'payment-completed' event when payment is successful
- Listen for relevant events from other modules

## Integration Points
- The module will import the Payment Processor module
- It will be initialized during application startup
- It will be shown/hidden based on the Access Control status

## Accessibility Considerations
- Ensure all form fields have proper labels
- Implement keyboard navigation
- Include appropriate ARIA attributes
- Ensure error messages are screen-reader friendly
