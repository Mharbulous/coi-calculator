# Task 3.7: Implement Application Mode Management

## Overview
This task involves creating a core system to manage application state between demo and paid modes. You'll implement a mode manager that handles initialization, transitions, and persistence of application mode, enabling the application to function properly in both modes.

## Complexity
Medium

## Estimated Time
1 hour

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Extend Zustand Store for Mode Management
1. Enhance the existing store to include mode-related state
   - Add app mode property (demo/paid)
   - Track initialization status
   - Store mode history for analytics
2. Implement mode-related actions
   - Add method to set application mode
   - Add method to check current mode
   - Add method for initial mode setup

### 2. Create Application Mode Manager
1. Implement a dedicated mode management service
   - Create singleton instance for app-wide access
   - Add initialization with mode detection
   - Implement mode switching functionality
   - Add mode persistence between sessions
2. Add upgrade source tracking for analytics
   - Track where upgrade attempts originate
   - Pass source information to payment system

### 3. Implement Mode Persistence
1. Add local storage functionality to remember mode between sessions
   - Store current mode with timestamp
   - Implement expiration for stored mode data
   - Validate stored mode during initialization
2. Add fallback mechanisms
   - Handle corrupted or invalid stored mode data
   - Default to demo mode when uncertain

### 4. Add Mode Change Notification System
1. Implement event-based notification for mode changes
   - Create custom event for mode transitions
   - Include relevant details in event data
   - Ensure proper event cleanup
2. Create handler registration functionality
   - Allow components to register for mode change notifications
   - Support priority-based handlers

### 5. Implement Mode-Specific Initialization
1. Add logic for different initialization processes based on mode
   - Load different resources for each mode
   - Set up appropriate UI components
   - Apply mode-specific configurations
2. Create startup checks
   - Verify authentication status for paid mode
   - Fall back to demo mode when authentication fails

### 6. Add Integration Points
1. Implement methods for external components to access mode information
   - Create simple API for mode checks
   - Add helper functions for common mode-related tasks
   - Ensure proper type checking and validation

## Testing Procedures
1. Test initialization in different scenarios
   - Fresh installation (no stored mode)
   - Returning user with stored mode
   - Authentication failure scenarios
2. Test mode switching
   - Demo to paid transition
   - Forced demo mode
   - Event propagation
3. Test persistence across page reloads
   - Mode retention
   - Expiration behavior
   - Invalid data handling

## Expected Outcome
1. Complete mode management system that handles demo and paid modes
2. Persistent mode state that survives page refreshes
3. Event system for notifying application components of mode changes
4. Clean API for mode-related operations
5. Integrated analytics for mode transitions and upgrade sources

## Notes
- The mode manager should work closely with authentication and payment systems
- Default to demo mode when in doubt for better user experience
- Include proper handling of edge cases (offline, authentication errors)
- Design API to be simple for other components to use
- This implementation incorporates requirements from Task A.4 (Implement Application Mode Management)
