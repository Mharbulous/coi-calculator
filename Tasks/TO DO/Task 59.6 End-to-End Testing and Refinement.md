# Task 59.6: End-to-End Testing and Refinement

## Background
After implementing all the individual components of the payment recording functionality, we need to conduct comprehensive end-to-end testing to ensure that everything works together seamlessly. This task focuses on verifying the entire payment recording flow and addressing any issues discovered during testing.

## Objective
Perform thorough end-to-end testing of the payment recording functionality, verify calculations match expected results, and refine the implementation to address any identified issues.

## Requirements

### Comprehensive Testing Scenarios
- Test the complete payment recording flow from button click to table rendering
- Verify calculations for multiple payment scenarios, including:
  - Single payment within an interest period
  - Multiple payments in different periods
  - Payments on period boundaries
  - Payments that exactly match the interest amount
  - Payments that cover interest plus partial principal
  - Payments that exceed the total amount owing

### Calculation Verification
- Compare calculated results with the examples in `pay_table.md`
- Verify that interest calculations before and after payments are correct
- Confirm that principal reduction is accurately tracked
- Ensure that subsequent interest periods use the correct reduced principal

### User Experience Refinement
- Verify that feedback to users is clear and helpful
- Ensure all UI elements related to payments are intuitive and consistent
- Test payment flow with different screen sizes
- Verify that error handling is robust and user-friendly

### Edge Case Handling Verification
- Test boundary conditions for payments:
  - Payment on the prejudgment start date
  - Payment on the judgment date
  - Payment on interest rate change dates
  - Payment on the postjudgment end date

## Implementation Steps
1. Create a test matrix covering all test scenarios
2. Execute each test scenario and document results
3. Compare results against expected values from `pay_table.md`
4. Identify and fix any discrepancies or bugs
5. Refine UI elements based on testing feedback
6. Ensure all edge cases are properly handled

## Testing
- Follow the test matrix to execute all test scenarios
- Document any issues found during testing
- Create additional test cases for any edge cases discovered
- Verify that fixes for identified issues don't introduce new problems

## Acceptance Criteria
- All test scenarios pass with expected results
- Calculations match the examples in `pay_table.md`
- The payment recording flow is intuitive and user-friendly
- Edge cases are handled correctly
- No critical bugs or calculation errors remain
- The implementation meets all requirements specified in Task 59
