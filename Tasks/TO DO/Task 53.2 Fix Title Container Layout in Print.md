# Task 53.2: Fix Title Container Layout in Print

## Overview

This task addresses the inconsistency between the screen and print versions of the title container margin. Currently, the title container has been given a `margin-bottom: 60px` in the screen version, but this spacing is not properly maintained in the print version. This affects the vertical spacing and alignment in the printed output, disrupting the WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) experience.

## Current State

- Screen version: `margin-bottom: 60px` (already set inline in HTML)
- Print version: Does not maintain the same margin (needs to be explicitly set)

This spacing discrepancy is noticeable when comparing the screen version to the print preview, particularly in the space between the title and the summary table.

## Implementation

Add a print-specific rule to maintain consistent title container spacing:

```css
/* Add to an appropriate CSS file with print media queries, such as print.css */

@media print {
  #title-container {
    margin-bottom: 60px !important; /* Match screen version, use !important to override inline styles if needed */
  }
}
```

Alternatively, if there isn't a dedicated print.css file, you can add this to the existing print media query section in one of the existing CSS files. The best location would be wherever other print styles are defined.

## Verification Steps

After implementing the changes:

1. First verify the screen version looks correct with the title container properly spaced
2. Use Print Preview (Ctrl+P or browser print functionality) to verify the spacing in print mode
3. Compare both views side by side to ensure consistency
4. Check that the title text has the same distance from the summary table in both versions
5. Verify that the overall layout looks balanced and visually identical in both modes

## Potential Issues to Watch For

1. **Specificity Conflicts**: If the rule isn't being applied, it might be due to higher specificity rules overriding it. In this case, you may need to increase specificity or use `!important` as a last resort.

2. **Inline Styles**: Since the margin-bottom is already set as an inline style in the HTML (`style="position: relative; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 60px;"`), ensure your print style has enough specificity to override it if needed.

3. **Print Scaling**: Browser print scaling might affect the actual spacing. Test with different scaling options.

4. **Page Breaks**: Ensure that the additional spacing doesn't create unwanted page breaks in the printed output.

5. **Redundant Rules**: Check for any existing print rules that might already be targeting the title container with different margin values.

## Related Changes

This change is part of Task 53 which added the Clear button with reset functionality. The spacing was added to accommodate the Clear button while maintaining proper alignment with the summary table.

## Expected Outcome

The title container should have consistent 60px bottom margin in both screen and print views, ensuring that the spacing between the title (and the newly added Clear button) and the summary table appears identical in both viewing modes.

## Implementation Notes

- Making this change will ensure that the bottom of the Clear button aligns with the top of the Summary table in the screen version, and the spacing is preserved in the print version (even though the Clear button itself is hidden during printing).
- This preserves the layout integrity while maintaining the intentional difference of hiding action buttons in print.
