# Task 0.2: Break Down Access Control Module Task

## Overview

This task involves breaking down Task 2 (Create Access Control Module for Firebase) into smaller, incremental subtasks. Each subtask should be simple to implement and reach a testable milestone toward the overall goal of creating a complete access control module for Firebase.

## Complexity

Simple

## Estimated Time

30 minutes

## Implementation Steps

### 1\. Review the Current Task 2 Requirements

1.  Examine the Task 2 description in Phase 1 - Firebase Paywall.md
2.  Identify all the major components needed for the access control module
3.  Understand the dependencies between components

### 2\. Break Down Task 2 into Smaller Subtasks

Divide Task 2 into 4-6 smaller subtasks, each focused on a specific aspect:

Suggested subtasks:

*   Task 2.1: Create Firebase Authentication Setup
*   Task 2.2: Implement User Sign-Up and Login UI
*   Task 2.3: Develop Access Token and Verification System
*   Task 2.4: Implement Session Management and Persistence
*   Task 2.5: Create Payment Verification Integration
*   Task 2.6: Develop Access Control Error Handling

### 3\. Create Markdown Files for Each Subtask

For each identified subtask, create a detailed markdown file containing:

*   Clear overview describing the purpose
*   Complexity rating (aim for "Simple" where possible)
*   Estimated time (15-30 minutes per subtask)
*   Detailed implementation steps
*   Testing procedures
*   Expected outcomes
*   Additional notes or considerations

### 4\. Update the Incremental Plan Table

1.  Open the Phase 1 - Firebase Paywall.md file
2.  Replace the Task 2 entry with the new subtasks in the Incremental Plan table
3.  Ensure time estimates and complexity ratings are accurate

## Expected Outcome

By the end of this task, you should have:

1.  Created 4-6 markdown files in the /Tasks/TO DO folder for Task 2 subtasks
2.  Updated the Phase 1 - Firebase Paywall.md Incremental Plan table
3.  Ensured each subtask is simple, focused, and leads to a testable milestone

## Notes

*   Focus on making each subtask simple enough to complete in 30 minutes or less
*   Ensure subtasks build logically on each other
*   Consider dependencies between subtasks and the overall Firebase integration process
*   Each subtask should reach a stable, testable state when completed
