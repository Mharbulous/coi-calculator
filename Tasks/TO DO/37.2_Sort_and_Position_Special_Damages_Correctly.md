# Subtask 37.2: Sort and Position Special Damages Correctly

## Goal
Ensure special damages are sorted by date and positioned correctly relative to interest periods.

## Implementation
- Review special damages insertion logic in `updateInterestTable()`
- Confirm sorting logic correctly handles the default special damages
- Ensure dates are properly formatted for comparison
- Verify insertion position logic for special damages rows

## Testing
- Check that special damages appear in date order
- Verify that special damages appear in correct positions relative to interest periods
- Test sorting with a mix of default and user-added special damages
