# Task 4.2: Create Payment Modal UI Components

## Overview
This task focuses on implementing the necessary UI components for the payment system, particularly the modal dialogs that will be used for user registration, login, and payment processing.

## Complexity
Simple

## Estimated Time
30 minutes

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Design Modal Framework
1. Create a reusable modal component structure:
   - Modal container with overlay
   - Header section with title and close button
   - Content area for forms and information
   - Footer area for action buttons
   - Animation and styling

### 2. Implement User Authentication Modals
1. Create the registration modal:
   - Email input
   - Password input (with confirmation)
   - Submit button
   - Link to login for existing users
   - Form validation feedback
   
2. Create the login modal:
   - Email input
   - Password input
   - Submit button
   - Link to registration for new users
   - Password reset option
   - Form validation feedback

### 3. Implement Payment Information Modal
1. Create the payment details modal:
   - Payment options selection (e.g., credit card, PayPal)
   - Credit card input fields (if applicable)
   - Billing information section
   - Payment amount and summary
   - Terms and conditions checkbox
   - Submit payment button
   - Cancel button

### 4. Create Status and Confirmation Modals
1. Implement payment processing status modal:
   - Loading indicator
   - Processing message
   
2. Create payment success modal:
   - Success message and icon
   - Order/transaction summary
   - "Continue to calculator" button
   
3. Create payment failure modal:
   - Error message and icon
   - Suggested resolution steps
   - Retry payment button
   - Contact support option

### 5. Implement Modal Styling
1. Create CSS for modal components:
   - Responsive design for different screen sizes
   - Consistent styling with the calculator's design
   - Smooth transitions and animations
   - Focus management for accessibility
   - Add to the existing styles folder structure

### 6. Add Modal Control Logic
1. Implement JavaScript functions to:
   - Show/hide modals
   - Transition between different modal states
   - Handle modal stacking (if needed)
   - Implement ESC key and overlay click handling

## Testing Procedures
- Test modal displays on different screen sizes
- Verify modals open and close properly
- Ensure keyboard navigation works correctly
- Test that form fields validate appropriately
- Verify that modals transition between each other as expected

## Expected Outcome
1. A set of styled and functional modal components
2. JavaScript functions to control modal visibility
3. Responsive design that works across devices
4. Clear and intuitive user interface for authentication and payment

## Notes
- Ensure modals are accessible according to WCAG guidelines
- Use consistent design language with the rest of the application
- Consider adding subtle animations for a polished user experience
- Ensure modals can be closed via multiple methods (X button, ESC key, clicking overlay)
- Implement form validation before submission to reduce user frustration
