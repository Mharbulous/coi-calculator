# Task 60.4: Implement Table Recalculation After Payment Insertion

## Goal
Ensure all calculations are properly updated after a payment is inserted, including total interest, principal balance, and subsequent interest calculations based on the reduced principal amount.

## Tasks
1. Refine the `recalculateTotals()` function to:
   - Properly account for payment impact on interest totals
   - Track principal reductions from payments
   - Ensure cumulative totals are accurate

2. Update how subsequent interest rows are recalculated:
   - Apply the new principal amount to all subsequent interest calculations
   - Handle changes in interest calculation based on reduced principal
   - Maintain accuracy across all calculation periods

3. Ensure cumulative interest and principal tracking is accurate:
   - Update running totals in the data model
   - Correctly accumulate interest across all segments
   - Handle edge cases like multiple payments within the same period

## Implementation Details
- Revise how principal and interest are tracked after payments
- Add logic to use the most recent principal amount for new calculations
- Implement chain-of-updates to ensure all dependent calculations are refreshed
- Add totals verification to ensure mathematical consistency

## Verification Method
- Compare calculations before and after a payment is added
- Console message showing updated totals:
  ```
  Recalculated totals after payment: Interest: $41.73, Principal: $9,843.59
  ```
- Verify that subsequent interest rows use the updated principal amount

## Dependencies
- Depends on completion of Task 60.3
- Uses interest calculation utilities from `calculations.js`

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Total interest value is correctly updated after payment insertion
- [ ] Principal balances are properly tracked and updated
- [ ] All rows following a payment use the new principal amount for calculations
- [ ] Running totals remain mathematically consistent
- [ ] Summary table accurately reflects all changes from payments
