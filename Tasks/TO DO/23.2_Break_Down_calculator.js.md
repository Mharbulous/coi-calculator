# Task 23.2: Break Down calculator.js

## Objective
Break down the `BC COIA calculator/calculator.js` file (currently 540 lines) into smaller, more focused files, each around 200-250 lines.

## Background
`calculator.js` contains the main application logic, including input handling, core calculations, UI updates, and initialization. Splitting this file based on responsibility (core logic vs. UI interaction) will improve organization and maintainability.

## File to Break Down
- `BC COIA calculator/calculator.js` (540 lines)

## Proposed New Files

Split into 2 files:
- **`BC COIA calculator/calculator.core.js`** (~250 lines)
  - Contains the core calculation orchestration function: `recalculate`.
  - Contains the primary calculation functions called by `recalculate`: `calculatePrejudgmentInterest`, `calculatePostjudgmentInterest`, `calculateJudgmentTotal`, `calculateFinalTotals`.
  - Contains error handling functions: `handleInvalidInputs`, `handleMissingRates`.
  - Import necessary functions from `calculations.js`, `utils.js`, `store.js`, etc.
  - Export the `recalculate` function.

- **`BC COIA calculator/calculator.ui.js`** (~200 lines)
  - Contains UI-related functions: `setupEventListeners`, `initializeCalculator`.
  - Contains functions that interact directly with the DOM for updates (which might call functions from `domUtils.js` or `dom/` submodules): `updatePrejudgmentTable`, `updatePostjudgmentTable`.
  - Contains functions for collecting data from the UI: `collectSpecialDamages`.
  - Import `recalculate` from `calculator.core.js`.
  - Import necessary functions/elements from `domUtils.js`, `dom/` submodules, `utils.js`, `store.js`, etc.
  - Ensure `initializeCalculator` sets up the initial state and calls `recalculate`.
  - The `DOMContentLoaded` listener should call `initializeCalculator` from this file.

## Implementation Strategy

1. Create the new files: `calculator.core.js`, `calculator.ui.js`.
2. Move the relevant functions (as listed above) into the corresponding new file.
3. Identify and move necessary import statements to each new file. Add new exports/imports between `calculator.core.js` and `calculator.ui.js` as needed (e.g., `calculator.ui.js` needs to import `recalculate`).
4. Ensure the `DOMContentLoaded` event listener in `calculator.ui.js` correctly calls `initializeCalculator`.
5. Update the `index.html` script tag to load `calculator.ui.js` instead of `calculator.js`.
6. Test the application thoroughly to ensure all functionality remains intact. Check for console errors.
7. Ensure all relevant unit/integration tests (if any exist for `calculator.js`) are updated and pass.
8. After confirming tests pass and the application works correctly, delete the original `calculator.js` file.

## Acceptance Criteria

- `calculator.js` is removed.
- `calculator.core.js` and `calculator.ui.js` are created.
- `calculator.core.js` contains the main calculation logic and orchestration.
- `calculator.ui.js` contains the UI setup, event listeners, and initialization logic.
- Each new file is around 200-250 lines.
- All necessary imports/exports are correctly configured between the new files and other modules.
- The application initializes correctly and all calculator functionality works as before.
- No console errors related to the refactoring.
