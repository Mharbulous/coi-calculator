# Task 59.5: Connect Payment Modal Confirmation to Processing Logic

## Background
We already have a payment modal UI in place with the `promptForPaymentDetails` function, and the Record Payment button that triggers it. However, the handler in `record-payment.js` currently only logs the payment details without processing them. We need to connect the button's confirmation action to the payment processing logic.

## Objective
Complete the payment recording flow by connecting the payment modal confirmation to the payment processing logic and updating the application state and UI accordingly.

## Requirements

### Payment Confirmation Handler
- Update the `handleRecordPaymentClick` function in `record-payment.js` to:
  - Process the received payment details using the payment processor
  - Update the store with the processed payment information
  - Trigger a recalculation of the interest table
  - Provide user feedback upon successful payment recording

### Input Validation
- Implement validation to prevent:
  - Invalid payment dates (must be within the prejudgment/postjudgment range)
  - Invalid payment amounts (must be positive numbers less than the total outstanding)
  - Display appropriate error messages for validation failures

### State Management
- Ensure the store is properly updated with the new payment
- Trigger a recalculation of all affected interest calculations
- Update all relevant totals (prejudgment interest, postjudgment interest, total owing)

### User Feedback
- Provide visual confirmation that a payment has been successfully recorded
- Close the modal after successful payment processing
- Ensure the UI refreshes to show the updated table with the new payment entry

## Implementation Steps
1. Update the `handleRecordPaymentClick` function to process payments
2. Add validation for payment dates and amounts
3. Connect to the payment processor to calculate payment application
4. Implement store updates with the processed payment
5. Add UI feedback for successful payment recording
6. Trigger table recalculation and rendering

## Testing
- Test recording payments with various valid amounts and dates
- Test validation with invalid inputs (out-of-range dates, negative amounts)
- Verify the full flow from modal input to table display
- Test with edge cases (payment on period boundaries, payment equal to total owed)

## Acceptance Criteria
- Users can successfully record payments via the modal
- Invalid inputs are rejected with appropriate error messages
- Payments are correctly applied to interest and principal
- The interest table updates to show the payment and its effects
- All calculations are recalculated correctly after a payment is recorded
