# Task 36.5: Implement Constraint Updates

## Objective
Ensure that special damages date constraints are automatically updated when related dates (Judgment Date or Prejudgment Interest Date) change.

## Requirements
1. Modify the date change handlers in datepickers.js to update special damages date constraints
2. Handle validation of existing special damages dates when constraints change
3. Provide visual feedback for dates that become invalid due to constraint changes
4. Ensure constraint updates are applied to all existing special damages rows

## Implementation Details

### 1. Update Judgment Date Change Handler
- Modify the `onJudgmentDateChange` function to:
  - Iterate through all special damages flatpickr instances
  - Update their maxDate constraint to the new Judgment Date
  - Validate existing dates against the new constraint
  - Clear and mark as invalid any dates that are now after the new Judgment Date

### 2. Update Prejudgment Date Change Handler
- Modify the `onPrejudgmentDateChange` function to:
  - Iterate through all special damages flatpickr instances
  - Calculate the day after the new Prejudgment Interest Date
  - Update their minDate constraint to this new date
  - Validate existing dates against the new constraint
  - Clear and mark as invalid any dates that are now before the new minDate

### 3. Centralize Constraint Updates
- Create a helper function `updateSpecialDamagesDateConstraints()` that:
  - Is called by both date change handlers
  - Updates all special damages date pickers with current constraints
  - Can be called independently when needed
  - Handles visual feedback for inputs with invalid dates

### 4. Handle Edge Cases
- Handle the case where changing constraints creates an impossible date range
- Ensure proper behavior when either Judgment Date or Prejudgment Interest Date is cleared
- Maintain proper coordination between different date pickers

## Acceptance Criteria
- When Judgment Date changes, all special damages date constraints are updated accordingly
- When Prejudgment Interest Date changes, all special damages date constraints are updated accordingly
- Special damages dates that become invalid due to constraint changes are cleared and marked with error styling
- Visual feedback clearly indicates when dates need to be updated

## Test Approach
For manual testing:
1. Add several special damages rows with different dates
2. Change the Judgment Date to an earlier date and verify:
   - Special damages dates that are now after Judgment Date are cleared and marked as invalid
   - The max date constraint for all special damages date pickers is updated
3. Change the Prejudgment Interest Date to a later date and verify:
   - Special damages dates that are now before one day after Prejudgment Date are cleared and marked as invalid
   - The min date constraint for all special damages date pickers is updated
