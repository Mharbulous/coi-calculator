# Step 1: Create Access Control Module

## Overview
The Access Control Module is the foundation of the paywall system. It handles checking whether users have paid for access to the calculator and manages the storage and retrieval of payment tokens.

## Implementation Details

### Create a New File
Create a new JavaScript module file named `access-control.js` in the BC COIA calculator directory.

### Module Functionality
The module should export an object with the following functionality:

1. **Check Access**: Determine if the user has access to the calculator
   - Verify if a valid payment token exists in localStorage
   - Check if the token has expired
   - Return a boolean indicating access status

2. **Payment Data Management**:
   - Store payment data after successful payment
   - Retrieve payment data from localStorage
   - Clear payment data (for testing or logout)

3. **Device Identification**:
   - Generate and store a unique device identifier
   - Use this identifier to potentially transfer access later

### Data Structure
The payment data structure should be designed to accommodate future authentication:
- Payment status (paid/unpaid)
- Transaction ID
- Timestamp of purchase
- Expiration date
- Email address (for receipt and future account association)
- Device identifier

### Forward Compatibility
Include fields in the data structure that will be useful when adding authentication:
- Email field to associate with future user accounts
- Device ID to potentially transfer access between devices
- Structured in a way that can be easily migrated to a user-based system

## Integration Points
- The module will be imported by the calculator initialization code
- It will be used by the Payment Processor module to store payment data
- It will be checked at application startup to determine if the calculator should be shown

## Testing Considerations
- Include a method to clear payment data for testing
- Consider adding a debug mode for development
