# Task 23.4: Break Down store.test.js

## Objective
Break down the `BC COIA calculator/store.test.js` file (currently 344 lines) into smaller, more focused test files, each around 200 lines.

## Background
`store.test.js` contains tests for the Zustand store, covering initial state, various actions (inputs, results, special damages, store management), and complex interactions. Splitting these tests logically will make them easier to navigate and maintain.

## File to Break Down
- `BC COIA calculator/store.test.js` (344 lines)

## Proposed New Files

Split into 2 files:
- **`BC COIA calculator/store.test.basic.js`** (~200 lines)
  - Contains tests for the initial state structure (`describe('Initial State', ...)`).
  - Contains tests for basic input actions (`describe('Input Actions', ...)`).
  - Contains tests for basic result actions (`describe('Result Actions', ...)`).
  - Include necessary imports (`useStore`, `vitest` functions).

- **`BC COIA calculator/store.test.advanced.js`** (~200 lines)
  - Contains tests for special damages actions (`describe('Special Damages Actions', ...)`).
  - Contains tests for store management actions (`describe('Store Management Actions', ...)`).
  - Contains tests for complex interactions (`describe('Complex Interactions', ...)`).
  - Include necessary imports (`useStore`, `vitest` functions).
  - Ensure `beforeEach` block for resetting the store is included in both files.

## Implementation Strategy

1. Create the new files: `store.test.basic.js`, `store.test.advanced.js`.
2. Copy the necessary imports (`useStore`, `describe`, `test`, `expect`, `beforeEach`) into both new files.
3. Copy the `beforeEach(() => { useStore.getState().resetStore(); });` block into both new files.
4. Move the `describe` blocks for 'Initial State', 'Input Actions', and 'Result Actions' into `store.test.basic.js`.
5. Move the `describe` blocks for 'Special Damages Actions', 'Store Management Actions', and 'Complex Interactions' into `store.test.advanced.js`.
6. Ensure all tests still pass after the refactoring (`npm test` or `npx vitest`).
7. After confirming tests pass, delete the original `store.test.js` file.

## Acceptance Criteria

- `store.test.js` is removed.
- `store.test.basic.js` and `store.test.advanced.js` are created.
- `store.test.basic.js` contains tests for initial state and basic input/result actions.
- `store.test.advanced.js` contains tests for special damages, store management, and complex interactions.
- Each new file is around 200 lines.
- All tests previously in `store.test.js` are now in the new files and pass successfully.
