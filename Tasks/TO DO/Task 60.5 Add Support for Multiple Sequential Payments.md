# Task 60.5: Add Support for Multiple Sequential Payments

## Goal
Handle multiple payments in chronological order with proper table updates, ensuring that each payment correctly builds on the state after previous payments and affects subsequent interest calculations appropriately.

## Tasks
1. Enhance the sorting and processing of multiple payments:
   - Ensure payments are processed in strict chronological order
   - Handle date comparisons properly regardless of input format
   - Improve error handling for invalid payment sequences

2. Ensure each payment correctly builds on the state after previous payments:
   - Track cumulative effects of multiple payments
   - Handle principal reduction correctly across a sequence of payments
   - Ensure interest calculations remain accurate after multiple payments

3. Implement proper validation for payment sequences:
   - Verify payment dates are valid relative to the calculation periods
   - Prevent invalid payment operations (e.g., payments exceeding principal)
   - Add warnings for potentially problematic payment sequences

## Implementation Details
- Improve the `processMultiplePayments()` function to handle complex sequences
- Implement a transaction-like approach to ensure consistent state
- Add logging for payment processing sequence
- Ensure interest totals are properly calculated considering all payments

## Verification Method
- Add two payments and verify the second payment's interest/principal allocation
- Console logging of payment processing sequence:
  ```
  Processing payments in sequence: [2020-10-13, 2020-12-01]
  Payment 1: $500.00 applied ($23.59 to interest, $476.41 to principal)
  Payment 2: $300.00 applied ($12.89 to interest, $287.11 to principal)
  ```

## Dependencies
- Depends on completion of Task 60.4
- Uses state management from `store.js`

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Multiple payments are processed in chronological order
- [ ] Each payment correctly affects subsequent interest calculations
- [ ] The principal for each period is accurately tracked
- [ ] Interest allocation for later payments considers earlier payments
- [ ] Console provides clear logging of the payment sequence processing

## Estimated Complexity
