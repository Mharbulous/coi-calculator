# Task 28: Simplify Interest Calculations

## Description

The current interest calculation logic in `calculations.js` is complex and difficult to maintain. The `calculateInterestPeriods` function handles both prejudgment and postjudgment interest calculations with special handling for different scenarios. This task aims to simplify the interest calculation logic while maintaining the same functionality.

## Current Implementation

The current implementation (see [OLD\_interest\_calculation.md](./OLD_interest_calculation.md) for a visual representation) has several areas of complexity:

The `calculateInterestPeriods` function is over 200 lines long and handles multiple responsibilities:

*   Calculating interest for regular periods
*   Special handling for final period damages
*   Managing principal amounts across different segments
*   Tracking special damages

Complex nested logic for determining:

*   Which special damages to include in which period
*   How to calculate interest for damages in the final period
*   When to update the principal amount

The function uses a while loop with multiple conditional branches, making the flow difficult to follow.

Special case handling is mixed with the main calculation logic.

## Proposed Simplification

The proposed simplified approach (see [SIMPLIFIED\_interest\_calculation\_overview.md](./SIMPLIFIED_interest_calculation_overview.md) for a high-level overview and [SIMPLIFIED\_interest\_calculation.md](./SIMPLIFIED_interest_calculation.md) for a detailed visual representation) breaks down the calculation into distinct, focused functions:

**Get Applicable Rate Periods**: Identify all interest rate periods that apply to the calculation date range.

**Process Special Damages**: Validate, sort, and group special damages by applicable segment.

**Calculate Interest for Each Segment**: Loop through rate segments and calculate interest for each.

**Calculate Special Damage Interest**: Handle special damages in the final period (for prejudgment interest only).

**Compile Results**: Calculate totals and format the final result object.

## Implementation Tasks

**Create Helper Functions**:

*   `getApplicableRatePeriods(startDate, endDate, interestType, jurisdiction, ratesData)`
*   `processSpecialDamages(specialDamages, segments)`
*   `calculateSegmentsInterestSimple(segments, principal)` - For calculating interest when no special damages exist
*   `calculateSegmentsInterestWithDamages(segments, principal, processedDamages)` - For calculating interest when special damages exist
*   `calculateSegmentInterest(segment, principal, rate, year)`
*   `calculateFinalPeriodDamageInterest(damages, endDate, interestType, jurisdiction, ratesData)` - For calculating interest individually for each special damage in the final period
*   `compileResults(segmentResults, damageResults, initialPrincipal, specialDamages, endDate)`

**Refactor Main Function**:

**Improve Error Handling**:

*   Add more robust validation
*   Provide clearer error messages
*   Handle edge cases explicitly

**Enhance Documentation**:

*   Add JSDoc comments for all functions
*   Document the calculation logic and business rules
*   Include examples for complex scenarios

## Testing Strategy

**Unit Tests**:

*   Create tests for each new helper function
*   Test with various inputs including edge cases

**Integration Tests**:

*   Test the refactored `calculateInterestPeriods` function with different scenarios
*   Compare results with the original implementation

**Regression Testing**:

*   Ensure the refactored code produces the same results as the original code
*   Test with real-world examples

**Edge Case Testing**:

*   Test one-day periods (related to Task 27)
*   Test with no special damages
*   Test with zero principal
*   Test with various date ranges

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  The refactored code produces the same results as the original code for all test cases.
2.  The code is more readable and maintainable, with smaller functions and clearer logic.
3.  All existing functionality is preserved, including special damages handling and one-day period calculations.
4.  Unit tests pass for all new and refactored functions.
5.  No regression in the application's behavior.

## Benefits of Simplification

1.  **Improved Maintainability**: Smaller, focused functions are easier to understand and modify.
2.  **Better Testability**: Isolated functions can be tested independently.
3.  **Enhanced Readability**: Clear function names and structure make the code easier to follow.
4.  **Reduced Complexity**: Simplified logic flow reduces the cognitive load for developers.
5.  **Easier Debugging**: Isolated functions make it easier to identify and fix issues.
6.  **Improved Efficiency**: Early checking for special damages avoids unnecessary processing when they don't exist.
7.  **Logical Flow**: The code follows a more intuitive sequence of operations that matches the business logic.

```javascript
function calculateInterestPeriods(state, interestType, startDate, endDate, initialPrincipal, ratesData) {
  // Basic validation
  if (!isValidInput(initialPrincipal, startDate, endDate, state, ratesData)) {
    return createEmptyResult(initialPrincipal);
  }
  
  const { jurisdiction } = state.inputs;
  const { specialDamages = [] } = state.results;
  
  // Get all applicable rate periods
  const segments = getApplicableRatePeriods(startDate, endDate, interestType, jurisdiction, ratesData);
  
  // Check if there are special damages first
  const hasSpecialDamages = specialDamages.length > 0;
  
  // Only process special damages if they exist
  const processedDamages = hasSpecialDamages 
    ? processSpecialDamages(specialDamages, segments) 
    : [];
  
  // Calculate interest for each segment (with or without special damages)
  const segmentResults = hasSpecialDamages
    ? calculateSegmentsInterestWithDamages(segments, initialPrincipal, processedDamages)
    : calculateSegmentsInterestSimple(segments, initialPrincipal);
  
  // Calculate special damage interest for final period only if needed 
  // (prejudgment and special damages exist)
  // This handles the special case where damages in the final period before judgment
  // have interest calculated individually rather than being lumped with the principal
  const damageResults = (interestType === 'prejudgment' && hasSpecialDamages)
    ? calculateFinalPeriodDamageInterest(processedDamages, endDate, interestType, jurisdiction, ratesData)
    : [];
  
  // Compile and return results
  return compileResults(segmentResults, damageResults, initialPrincipal, processedDamages, endDate);
}
