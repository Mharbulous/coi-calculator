# Task 23.4: Break Down store.test.js

## Objective
Break down the `BC COIA calculator/store.test.js` file (currently 344 lines) into smaller, more focused test files, each around 200 lines.

## Background
`store.test.js` contains tests for the Zustand store, covering initial state, various actions (inputs, results, special damages, store management), and complex interactions. Splitting these tests logically will make them easier to navigate and maintain.

## File to Break Down
- `BC COIA calculator/store.test.js` (344 lines)

## Proposed New Files

Split into 2 files:
- **`BC COIA calculator/store.test.basic.js`** (~200 lines)
  - Contains tests for the initial state structure (`describe('Initial State', ...)`).
  - Contains tests for basic input actions (`describe('Input Actions', ...)`).
  - Contains tests for basic result actions (`describe('Result Actions', ...)`).
  - Include necessary imports (`useStore`, `vitest` functions).

- **`BC COIA calculator/store.test.advanced.js`** (~200 lines)
  - Contains tests for special damages actions (`describe('Special Damages Actions', ...)`).
  - Contains tests for store management actions (`describe('Store Management Actions', ...)`).
  - Contains tests for complex interactions (`describe('Complex Interactions', ...)`).
  - Include necessary imports (`useStore`, `vitest` functions).
  - Ensure `beforeEach` block for resetting the store is included in both files.

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Important:** First, update the Vitest configuration in `vitest.config.js` to recognize the new test file naming pattern by adding `'**/*.test.*.js'` to the include array if not already done in Task 23.1:
   ```javascript
   include: [
     '**/*.test.js',
     '**/*.test.*.js'
   ],
   ```
2. Create the new files: `store.test.basic.js`, `store.test.advanced.js`.
3. Copy the necessary imports (`useStore`, `describe`, `test`, `expect`, `beforeEach`) into both new files.
4. Copy the `beforeEach(() => { useStore.getState().resetStore(); });` block into both new files.
5. Move the `describe` blocks for 'Initial State', 'Input Actions', and 'Result Actions' into `store.test.basic.js`.
6. Move the `describe` blocks for 'Special Damages Actions', 'Store Management Actions', and 'Complex Interactions' into `store.test.advanced.js`.
7. Run tests to verify each new file works correctly: `npx vitest run` (avoid using file paths with spaces in the command).
8. After confirming all tests pass, delete the original `store.test.js` file.
9. Run tests again to ensure everything still works after removing the original file.

## Potential Issues and Solutions

- **Test file pattern recognition:** Vitest by default only recognizes `*.test.js` files. Make sure the configuration is updated as noted above.
- **Running specific test files:** When running specific test files, use proper escaping for spaces in file paths or use the pattern matching in the Vitest configuration.
- **Store state interference:** Ensure each test file properly resets the store state before each test to avoid interference between tests.
- **Console warnings:** Some tests may intentionally trigger console warnings. These are expected and part of the test coverage.
- **Missing imports:** Make sure all necessary imports are included in each new file, especially any helper functions used in the tests.

## Acceptance Criteria

- `store.test.js` is removed.
- `store.test.basic.js` and `store.test.advanced.js` are created.
- `store.test.basic.js` contains tests for initial state and basic input/result actions.
- `store.test.advanced.js` contains tests for special damages, store management, and complex interactions.
- Each new file is around 200 lines.
- Vitest configuration is updated to recognize the new test file naming pattern.
- All tests previously in `store.test.js` are now in the new files and pass successfully.
- No test failures or unexpected console errors after the refactoring.
