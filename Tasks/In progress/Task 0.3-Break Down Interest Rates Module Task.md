# Task 0.3: Break Down Interest Rates Module Task

## Overview
This task involves breaking down Task 3 (Modify Interest Rates Module for Firebase) into smaller, incremental subtasks. Each subtask should be simple to implement and reach a testable milestone toward the overall goal of refactoring the interest rates module to fetch data from Firebase instead of using hardcoded values.

## Complexity
Simple

## Estimated Time
30 minutes

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Review the Current Task 3 Requirements
1. Examine the Task 3 description in Phase 1 - Firebase Paywall.md
2. Review the current interestRates.js implementation to understand its structure
3. Identify key components that need to be modified for Firebase integration

### 2. Break Down Task 3 into Smaller Subtasks
Divide Task 3 into 4-6 smaller subtasks, each focused on a specific aspect:

Suggested subtasks:
- Task 3.1: Create Firebase Data Fetching Service
- Task 3.2: Implement Local Data Caching Mechanism
- Task 3.3: Modify Rate Processing Function for Firebase Data
- Task 3.4: Add Offline Fallback Functionality
- Task 3.5: Implement Error Handling and Logging
- Task 3.6: Create Rate Data Refresh Mechanism

### 3. Create Markdown Files for Each Subtask
For each identified subtask, create a detailed markdown file containing:
- Clear overview describing the purpose
- Complexity rating (aim for "Simple" where possible)
- Estimated time (15-30 minutes per subtask)
- Detailed implementation steps
- Testing procedures
- Expected outcomes
- Additional notes or considerations

### 4. Update the Incremental Plan Table
1. Open the Phase 1 - Firebase Paywall.md file
2. Replace the Task 3 entry with the new subtasks in the Incremental Plan table
3. Ensure time estimates and complexity ratings are accurate

## Expected Outcome
By the end of this task, you should have:
1. Created 4-6 markdown files in the /Tasks/TO DO folder for Task 3 subtasks
2. Updated the Phase 1 - Firebase Paywall.md Incremental Plan table
3. Ensured each subtask is simple, focused, and leads to a testable milestone

## Notes
- Focus on making each subtask simple enough to complete in 30 minutes or less
- Ensure the modified interestRates.js maintains compatibility with existing code
- Consider both online and offline usage scenarios
- Prioritize performance and reliability for rate data access
- Each subtask should reach a stable, testable state when completed
