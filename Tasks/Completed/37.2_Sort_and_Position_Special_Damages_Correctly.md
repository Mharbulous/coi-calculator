# Subtask 37.2: Sort and Position Special Damages Correctly

## Goal
Ensure special damages are sorted by date and positioned correctly relative to interest periods.

## Implementation Details
- Improved the special damages insertion logic in `updateInterestTable()` to properly sort items by date
- Enhanced the row insertion process to correctly position special damages in relation to interest periods
- Added clear handling for all types of date formats within the comparison logic
- Created more robust row collection and sorting before insertion to ensure consistent ordering
- Added test cases to verify sorting and positioning functionality

## Testing
- Created `sort.special.damages.test.js` to test the sorting functionality
- Verified that special damages appear in date order
- Confirmed that special damages appear in correct positions relative to interest periods
- Tested with both default and dynamically added special damages

## Results
- Special damages now correctly sort by date
- Rows insert in the proper position between interest periods
- Mixed default and user-added special damages sort properly
- Date comparison issues are now resolved

## Key Changes
1. Enhanced row sorting in `tables.interest.js` to properly compare dates
2. Improved the row insertion mechanism to place rows at the correct positions
3. Added comprehensive tests to verify order is correctly maintained
