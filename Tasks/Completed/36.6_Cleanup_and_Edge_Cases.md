# Task 36.6: Cleanup and Edge Cases

## Objective
Ensure proper cleanup of flatpickr instances and handle edge cases for robustness in the special damages date picker implementation.

## Requirements
1. Implement proper cleanup of flatpickr instances when special damages rows are removed
2. Handle edge cases with date visibility and state changes
3. Ensure all scenarios are covered for a robust implementation
4. Add comprehensive integration tests

## Implementation Details

### 1. Implement Cleanup for Removed Rows
- Identify when and how special damages rows are removed from the DOM
- Ensure `destroySpecialDamagesDatePicker` is called before row removal
- Prevent memory leaks by removing all references to destroyed instances
- Test removal scenarios to verify proper cleanup

### 2. Handle Visibility Edge Cases
- Ensure proper behavior when Prejudgment Interest section is hidden/shown
- Handle cases where dates become invalid due to visibility changes
- Verify that constraints are correctly applied when section visibility changes
- Update special damages date pickers when visibility state changes

### 3. Integration with Table Updates
- Review `updateInterestTable` in tables.interest.js to ensure proper handling of date pickers during table updates
- Ensure special damages rows and their date pickers are properly managed during table regeneration
- Verify that sorting and positioning of rows maintains proper date picker functionality

### 4. Comprehensive Testing
- Test all edge cases:
  - What happens when there are no valid dates between constraints?
  - What happens when dates are manually edited to invalid values?
  - How does the system handle rapid changes to multiple date constraints?
  - What happens during state restoration with invalid dates?

### 5. Documentation
- Add inline comments explaining the edge case handling
- Document any limitations or potential issues for future maintenance
- Ensure the codebase is consistent and follows established patterns

## Acceptance Criteria
- No memory leaks: flatpickr instances are properly destroyed when rows are removed
- Robustness: all edge cases are properly handled with appropriate user feedback
- No console errors in any usage scenario
- Clean, maintainable code with proper documentation

## Test Approach
For manual testing:
1. Test row removal and verify no memory leaks (check browser memory usage)
2. Test various edge cases:
   - Hide prejudgment section with special damages rows, then show it again
   - Create an impossible date range by setting Judgment Date before Prejudgment Date + 1
   - Rapidly change dates in multiple inputs
   - Create, delete, and restore multiple special damages rows
3. Verify no console errors appear during any of these operations
