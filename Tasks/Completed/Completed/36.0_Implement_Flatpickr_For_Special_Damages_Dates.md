# Task 36: Implement Flatpickr for Special Damages Dates

## Overview
Currently, the app uses flatpickr for Judgment Date, Prejudgment Interest Date, and Postjudgment Interest Date, but special damages dates are entered manually without using flatpickr. This task series implements flatpickr for special damages dates with appropriate constraints.

## Requirements
1. Implement flatpickr for special damages date inputs in the same way it's implemented for other date fields
2. Apply date constraints:
   - Earliest possible date: One day after the Prejudgment Interest Date
   - Latest possible date: The Judgment Date
3. Ensure proper visual feedback for date errors
4. Update all related functionality to work with the new implementation

## Implementation Approach
This feature will be implemented in six incremental, testable stages:

### Stage 1: Extend datepickers.js with Special Damages Support (Task 36.1)
- Add storage for special damages flatpickr instances
- Create basic initialization and destruction functions
- Export the new functions for use in other modules

### Stage 2: Implement Basic Date Constraints (Task 36.2)
- Add constraint logic to the special damages flatpickr initialization
- Implement validation and error feedback
- Handle edge cases for constraint application

### Stage 3: Update Special Damages Creation (Task 36.3)
- Modify row creation to use flatpickr instead of basic date inputs
- Ensure proper initialization with constraints
- Verify recalculation integration

### Stage 4: Update Special Damages Restoration (Task 36.4)
- Update the row restoration process to use flatpickr
- Ensure proper handling of calculation details
- Test with prejudgment toggle functionality

### Stage 5: Implement Constraint Updates (Task 36.5)
- Update date change handlers to maintain constraints across all date pickers
- Handle validation of existing dates when constraints change
- Provide visual feedback for invalid dates

### Stage 6: Cleanup and Edge Cases (Task 36.6)
- Ensure proper cleanup of flatpickr instances
- Handle edge cases and visibility changes
- Add comprehensive testing and documentation

## Success Criteria
- Special damages dates use flatpickr with the same look and feel as other date inputs
- Date constraints are properly enforced
- Visual feedback is provided for invalid dates
- All existing functionality is maintained
- No memory leaks or console errors in any usage scenario
