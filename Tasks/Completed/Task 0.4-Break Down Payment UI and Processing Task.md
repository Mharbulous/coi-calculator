# Task 0.4: Break Down Payment UI and Processing Task

## Overview
This task involves breaking down Task 4 (Implement Payment UI and Processing) into smaller, incremental subtasks. Each subtask should be simple to implement and reach a testable milestone toward the overall goal of creating a payment system for the interest rate data access.

## Complexity
Simple

## Estimated Time
30 minutes

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Review the Current Task 4 Requirements
1. Examine the Task 4 description in Phase 1 - Firebase Paywall.md
2. Research payment processing options compatible with Firebase
3. Identify key UI components needed for the payment flow

### 2. Break Down Task 4 into Smaller Subtasks
Divide Task 4 into 5-7 smaller subtasks, each focused on a specific aspect:

Suggested subtasks:
- Task 4.1: Design Payment Flow and User Experience
- Task 4.2: Create Payment Modal UI Components
- Task 4.3: Implement Payment Form and Validation
- Task 4.4: Set Up Payment Processor Integration (Stripe/PayPal)
- Task 4.5: Create Payment Success/Failure Handling
- Task 4.6: Implement Payment Receipt and Confirmation
- Task 4.7: Add User Account Status UI Elements

### 3. Create Markdown Files for Each Subtask
For each identified subtask, create a detailed markdown file containing:
- Clear overview describing the purpose
- Complexity rating (aim for "Simple" where possible)
- Estimated time (15-30 minutes per subtask)
- Detailed implementation steps
- Testing procedures
- Expected outcomes
- Additional notes or considerations

### 4. Update the Incremental Plan Table
1. Open the Phase 1 - Firebase Paywall.md file
2. Replace the Task 4 entry with the new subtasks in the Incremental Plan table
3. Ensure time estimates and complexity ratings are accurate

## Expected Outcome
By the end of this task, you should have:
1. Created 5-7 markdown files in the /Tasks/TO DO folder for Task 4 subtasks
2. Updated the Phase 1 - Firebase Paywall.md Incremental Plan table
3. Ensured each subtask is simple, focused, and leads to a testable milestone

## Notes
- Focus on making each subtask simple enough to complete in 30 minutes or less
- Consider the user experience throughout the payment process
- Prioritize security for payment information handling
- Ensure compatibility with Firebase Authentication
- Consider different payment models (one-time, subscription)
- Each subtask should reach a stable, testable state when completed
