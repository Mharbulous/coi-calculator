# Task: 12.1 Zustand Refactor - Phase 1: Store Implementation & Isolated Testing

**Goal:** Define and implement the Zustand store based on the existing `appState` and verify its core logic using isolated Jest tests.

**Depends On:** Task 12.0 (Environment Setup)

**Steps:**

1.  **Analyze `appState`:**
    *   Read `src/calculator.js` to fully understand the structure, properties, and current modification methods of the global `appState` object.
    *   Document the identified state properties and how they are currently updated.
2.  **Design Zustand Store:**
    *   Based on the analysis, design the equivalent state structure within a Zustand store.
    *   Define the actions (functions) needed to update this state, mirroring the existing logic but using Zustand's `set` function.
3.  **Implement Zustand Store:**
    *   Create a new file: `src/store.js`.
    *   Implement the store using `import { create } from 'zustand';` (this import works in Node/Jest because of the dev dependency installed in Phase 0).
    *   Define the state and actions identified in the design step. Export the created store hook (e.g., `export default useStore;`).
4.  **Write Isolated Store Tests (Jest):**
    *   Create a new test file: `src/store.test.js`.
    *   Write Jest tests that import the store (`import useStore from './store.js';`).
    *   Test the initial state of the store upon creation.
    *   Test each action by calling it and asserting that the state is updated correctly using `useStore.getState()`.
    *   Ensure comprehensive coverage of all state properties and actions.
5.  **Run & Verify Tests:**
    *   Execute the Jest test suite (`npm test` or equivalent).
    *   Ensure all tests in `store.test.js` pass. Debug any failures in the store logic or test setup. Address any Jest configuration issues needed for ES module imports if they arise (though `npm install --save-dev zustand` should help).
