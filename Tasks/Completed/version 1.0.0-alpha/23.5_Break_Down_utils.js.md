# Task 23.5: Break Down utils.js

## Objective
Break down the `BC COIA calculator/utils.js` file (currently 316 lines) into smaller, more focused utility files, each around 200 lines.

## Background
`utils.js` contains various utility functions for date and currency manipulation. Separating these into distinct files based on their domain (date vs. currency) will improve code organization and make it easier to find relevant helper functions.

## File to Break Down
- `BC COIA calculator/utils.js` (316 lines)

## Proposed New Files

Split into 2 files:
- **`BC COIA calculator/utils.date.js`** (~200 lines)
  - Contains all date-related utility functions:
    - `normalizeDate`
    - `datesEqual`
    - `dateBefore`
    - `dateAfter`
    - `dateOnOrBefore`
    - `dateOnOrAfter`
    - `validateDateFormat`
    - `parseDateInput`
    - `formatDateForDisplay`
    - `formatDateForInput`
    - `formatDateLong`
    - `daysBetween`
    - `isLeap`
    - `daysInYear`
  - Export all these functions.

- **`BC COIA calculator/utils.currency.js`** (~200 lines)
  - Contains all currency-related utility functions:
    - `parseCurrency`
    - `currencyFormatter` (internal constant)
    - `formatCurrencyForInput`
    - `formatCurrencyForInputWithCommas`
    - `formatCurrencyForDisplay`
  - Export the public functions (`parseCurrency`, `formatCurrencyForInput`, `formatCurrencyForInputWithCommas`, `formatCurrencyForDisplay`).

## Implementation Strategy

1. Create the new files: `utils.date.js`, `utils.currency.js`.
2. Move the date-related functions listed above into `utils.date.js`. Add necessary `export` statements for each function.
3. Move the currency-related functions listed above into `utils.currency.js`. Add necessary `export` statements for the public functions.
4. Update all files that previously imported functions from `utils.js` to import them from the specific new files (`utils.date.js` or `utils.currency.js`). This will likely include files like:
   - `calculations.js`
   - `calculator.js` (or `calculator.core.js` and `calculator.ui.js` if Task 23.2 is completed)
   - `dom/` modules
   - Test files
5. Create a comprehensive list of all files that import from `utils.js` by using a search command like:
   ```
   npx grep -r "from './utils" --include="*.js" .
   ```
6. Test the application thoroughly:
   - Open the application in a browser and verify all date and currency formatting works correctly
   - Check that calculations using date functions work properly
   - Verify currency inputs and displays are formatted correctly
   - Check for console errors
7. After confirming the application works correctly, delete the original `utils.js` file.
8. Test the application again after removing the original file to ensure everything still works.

## Potential Issues and Solutions

- **Missing imports**: When updating import statements, make sure to import all necessary functions from the new files. Check for any functions that might be used but not explicitly imported (e.g., through destructuring).
- **Function dependencies**: Some utility functions might depend on other utility functions. Make sure these dependencies are properly handled when splitting the files.
- **Internal helpers**: Check for any internal helper functions or constants that might be used by multiple exported functions, and ensure they're included in the appropriate file.
- **Test files**: Remember that test files will also need to be updated to import from the new utility files. This will be addressed in Task 23.6, but you should be aware of it.
- **Console errors**: Pay attention to any console errors that might indicate missing functions or incorrect imports.

## Acceptance Criteria

- `utils.js` is removed.
- `utils.date.js` and `utils.currency.js` are created.
- `utils.date.js` contains only date-related utility functions.
- `utils.currency.js` contains only currency-related utility functions.
- Each new file is around 200 lines.
- All necessary functions are exported from the new files.
- Imports in other modules are updated correctly.
- The application's date and currency handling works as before.
- No console errors related to the refactoring.
- All associated unit tests pass after being updated (Task 23.6).
