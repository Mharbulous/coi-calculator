# Task 36.4: Update Special Damages Restoration

## Objective
Modify the special damages restoration process to use flatpickr for date inputs when recreating rows from saved data.

## Requirements
1. Update the `insertSpecialDamagesRowFromData` function in specialDamages.js to use flatpickr
2. Ensure proper initialization of date pickers for restored rows
3. Handle the restoration of date constraints correctly
4. Maintain all existing functionality of the restored special damages rows

## Implementation Details

### 1. Update `insertSpecialDamagesRowFromData` Function
- Modify the function to:
  - Create the date input as before
  - Replace `setupCustomDateInputListeners` with a call to `initializeSpecialDamagesDatePicker`
  - Pass the appropriate recalculation callback
  - Ensure the date is properly initialized from the saved data

### 2. Handle Calculated Interest Details
- Ensure the date input flatpickr initialization doesn't interfere with the display of calculated interest details
- Preserve the existing functionality that displays the end date and interest calculation details

### 3. Test with Prejudgment Toggle
- Ensure special damages rows are properly restored when toggling prejudgment visibility off and on
- Verify date pickers are properly initialized on restored rows
- Confirm that date constraints are correctly applied to restored rows

### 4. State Management Integration
- Verify that the Zustand store's restoration logic works correctly with the new flatpickr implementation
- Ensure special damages dates are properly preserved and restored from the store

## Acceptance Criteria
- Special damages rows restored from saved data use flatpickr for the date input
- The date picker is initialized with the correct date and constraints
- Toggling prejudgment visibility off and on properly restores special damages rows with functioning date pickers
- All calculation details and formatting are preserved in the restored rows

## Test Approach
For manual testing:
1. Add several special damages rows with different dates
2. Toggle the "Show Prejudgment" checkbox off
3. Toggle the "Show Prejudgment" checkbox back on
4. Verify all special damages rows are restored with working flatpickr date pickers
5. Verify the dates and other data are preserved correctly
6. Verify all calculation details are displayed correctly
