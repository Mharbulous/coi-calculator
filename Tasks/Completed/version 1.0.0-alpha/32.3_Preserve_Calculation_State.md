# Task 32.3: Preserve Calculation State When Toggling Prejudgment Interest Checkbox

*This is part of [Task 32: Enhance Prejudgment Interest Checkbox Behavior](./32_Enhance_Prejudgment_Interest_Checkbox_Behavior.md)*

## Current Behavior

Currently, when toggling the "Show prejudgment interest" checkbox:
- The prejudgment interest calculation table is shown or hidden based on the checkbox state
- The calculation state (including special damages entries) is not fully preserved when toggling
- When unchecking the checkbox, the prejudgment interest amount becomes $0.00
- When checking the checkbox again, the calculation is performed from scratch

This behavior can be frustrating for users who want to temporarily disable the prejudgment interest calculation without losing their work or having to re-enter special damages.

## Required Changes

1. Modify the `togglePrejudgmentVisibility` function in `visibility.js` to:
   - Preserve the complete calculation state when toggling the checkbox
   - Store the last calculated prejudgment interest value when unchecking
   - Restore the calculation state when checking again

2. Update the `recalculate` function in `calculator.core.js` to:
   - Preserve special damages and other calculation details when the checkbox is toggled
   - Ensure that toggling the checkbox doesn't erase the calculation table state

3. Ensure that the state management in the Zustand store properly handles preserving and restoring the calculation state.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Modify `togglePrejudgmentVisibility` in `visibility.js`

The function needs to be updated to preserve the calculation state when toggling the checkbox:

- When unchecking the checkbox:
  - Save the current prejudgment interest calculation state in the Zustand store
  - This includes the calculated interest value, special damages, and any other relevant state

- When checking the checkbox:
  - Restore the saved calculation state from the Zustand store
  - Ensure that special damages and other calculation details are preserved

This will require:
- Adding state properties to store the saved calculation state
- Updating the toggle function to handle saving and restoring this state

### 2. Update `recalculate` in `calculator.core.js`

The `recalculate` function needs to be updated to handle preserving the calculation state:

- When the checkbox is unchecked:
  - Skip the prejudgment interest calculation
  - Use the saved calculation state for the total calculation
  - Ensure special damages are preserved

- When the checkbox is checked:
  - Use the saved calculation state as a starting point
  - Perform the calculation based on the current inputs
  - Preserve special damages and other calculation details

### 3. Update State Management in Zustand Store

The Zustand store needs to be updated to handle preserving and restoring the calculation state:

- Add state properties to store the saved calculation state
- Update the store actions to handle saving and restoring this state
- Ensure that the state is properly maintained when toggling the checkbox

This might involve:
- Adding a new property to the store to hold the saved prejudgment interest calculation state
- Adding actions to save and restore this state
- Updating existing actions to handle the saved state

## Expected Outcome

After implementing these changes:

- When the "Show prejudgment interest" checkbox is unchecked:
  - The prejudgment interest calculation table will be hidden
  - The prejudgment interest date field will be hidden (as implemented in Task 32.1)
  - The prejudgment interest amount will be editable (as implemented in Task 32.2)
  - All special damages and other calculation details will be preserved

- When the "Show prejudgment interest" checkbox is checked again:
  - The prejudgment interest calculation table will be shown
  - The prejudgment interest date field will be shown
  - The prejudgment interest amount will be calculated based on the current inputs
  - All special damages and other calculation details will be preserved
  - The user will not need to re-enter any data

This will provide a seamless experience for users who want to temporarily disable the prejudgment interest calculation without losing their work.
