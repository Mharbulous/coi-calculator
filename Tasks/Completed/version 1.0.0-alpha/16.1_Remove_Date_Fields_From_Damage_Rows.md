# Task 16.1: Remove Date Fields From Damage Rows

## Description
Currently, the rows for General Damages & Debt, Special Damages, Non-pecuniary damages, and Costs & Disbursements display date fields in the summary table. Since the judgment date is now entered in the header next to the "Judgment" heading, these date fields are redundant and should be removed. This task involves modifying the summary table to remove these date fields without affecting the interest calculation logic for prejudgment and postjudgment interest.

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Modify the templates in index.html
- Update the templates for the summary table rows to remove the date column for the damage rows
- Ensure that the templates still maintain the correct structure for the interest rows

### 2. Update the tables.js file
- Modify the `updateSummaryTable` function to handle the new template structure
- Ensure that the date values are still properly passed to the calculation logic
- Update the template selection logic to use the appropriate templates for each row type

### 3. Update the inputs.js file
- Ensure that the date values are still properly collected from the judgment date input field
- Maintain the synchronization between the judgment date input field and the calculation logic

### 4. Testing
- Test that removing the date fields does not affect the interest calculation logic
- Verify that the summary table displays correctly without the date fields
- Ensure that all calculations still work correctly with the new layout

## Files to Modify
1. `BC COIA calculator/index.html`
2. `BC COIA calculator/dom/tables.js`
3. `BC COIA calculator/dom/inputs.js`

## Expected Outcome
The summary table will display the rows for General Damages & Debt, Special Damages, Non-pecuniary damages, and Costs & Disbursements without date fields, while maintaining the correct interest calculation logic. The judgment date will be entered only once in the header next to the "Judgment" heading.
