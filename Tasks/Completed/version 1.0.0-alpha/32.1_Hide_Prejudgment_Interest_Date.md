# Task 32.1: Hide Prejudgment Interest Date When Checkbox is Unchecked

*This is part of [Task 32: Enhance Prejudgment Interest Checkbox Behavior](./32_Enhance_Prejudgment_Interest_Checkbox_Behavior.md)*

## Current Behavior

Currently, when the "Show prejudgment interest" checkbox is unchecked:
- The prejudgment interest calculation section (table) is hidden
- However, the prejudgment interest date field in the summary table remains visible
- The help icon and "from" text next to the date field also remain visible
- The prejudgment interest amount shows $0.00 and is not editable
- The state still maintains the prejudgment start date value

This behavior is inconsistent with how the "Show postjudgment interest" checkbox works, which completely removes the postjudgment interest row from the summary table when unchecked.

## Postjudgment Interest Checkbox Reference

The "Show postjudgment interest" checkbox currently:
- Hides the postjudgment interest section (table) when unchecked
- Completely removes the postjudgment interest row from the summary table when unchecked
- Adjusts the validation logic to not require a valid postjudgment date when the checkbox is unchecked
- Preserves the postjudgment end date value in the state for when the checkbox is checked again

## Required Changes

1. Modify the `togglePrejudgmentVisibility` function in `visibility.js` to:
   - Find the prejudgment interest row in the summary table
   - Hide the date input field, help icon, and "from" text when the checkbox is unchecked
   - Show these elements when the checkbox is checked
   - Preserve the date value in the state for when the checkbox is checked again

2. Update the validation logic in `inputs.js` to:
   - Not require a valid prejudgment date when the checkbox is unchecked
   - Similar to how postjudgment date validation is handled

3. Ensure the `updateSummaryTable` function in `tables.summary.js` correctly handles the visibility of the prejudgment interest date field based on the checkbox state.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Modify `togglePrejudgmentVisibility` in `visibility.js`

The function needs to be updated to handle the prejudgment interest date field in the summary table. It should:
- Find the prejudgment interest row in the summary table
- Toggle the visibility of the date input field, help icon, and "from" text based on the checkbox state
- Preserve the date value in the state

### 2. Update Validation Logic in `inputs.js`

The `validateInputValues` function needs to be updated to not require a valid prejudgment date when the checkbox is unchecked. Currently, it checks:

```javascript
if (!inputs.dateOfJudgment || 
    !inputs.nonPecuniaryJudgmentDate || !inputs.costsAwardedDate || 
    (inputs.showPrejudgment && !inputs.prejudgmentStartDate) ||
    (inputs.showPostjudgment && !inputs.postjudgmentEndDate)) {
    validationMessage = "One or more required dates are missing or invalid.";
    isValid = false;
}
```

This logic already handles the prejudgment date validation correctly, as it only requires the prejudgment start date when `inputs.showPrejudgment` is true. However, we should review the rest of the validation logic to ensure it's consistent.

### 3. Update `updateSummaryTable` in `tables.summary.js`

The `updateSummaryTable` function needs to be reviewed to ensure it correctly handles the visibility of the prejudgment interest date field based on the checkbox state. It should:
- Check the state of the prejudgment interest checkbox
- Only include the date field, help icon, and "from" text in the prejudgment interest row if the checkbox is checked

## Expected Outcome

After implementing these changes:
- When the "Show prejudgment interest" checkbox is unchecked:
  - The prejudgment interest calculation section (table) will be hidden
  - The prejudgment interest date field, help icon, and "from" text in the summary table will also be hidden
  - The prejudgment interest amount will still show $0.00 (this will be addressed in Task 32.2)
  - The state will still maintain the prejudgment start date value
- When the checkbox is checked again:
  - All elements will be visible again
  - The previously entered date will be restored

This will make the behavior consistent with how the "Show postjudgment interest" checkbox works.
