# Task 23.6: Break Down utils.test.js

## Objective

Break down the `src/utils.test.js` file (currently 586 lines) into smaller, more focused test files, corresponding to the new utility files created in Task 23.5. Each new test file should be around 200-300 lines.

## Background

`utils.test.js` contains tests for all functions in the original `utils.js`. Since `utils.js` is being split into `utils.date.js` and `utils.currency.js` (Task 23.5), the corresponding tests should also be split to maintain alignment between source files and their tests.

## File to Break Down

- `src/utils.test.js` (586 lines)

## Prerequisite

- Task 23.5 (Break Down utils.js) must be completed first, creating `utils.date.js` and `utils.currency.js`.

## Proposed New Files

Split into 2 files:

- **`src/utils.test.date.js`** (~300 lines)
  - Contains tests for all functions now residing in `utils.date.js`:
    - `normalizeDate`
    - `datesEqual`
    - `dateBefore`
    - `dateAfter`
    - `dateOnOrBefore`
    - `dateOnOrAfter`
    - `parseDateInput`
    - `formatDateForDisplay`
    - `formatDateForInput`
    - `formatDateLong`
    - `daysBetween`
    - `isLeap`
    - `daysInYear`
  - Import functions from `./utils.date.js`.
  - Include necessary `vitest` imports and helper functions (like `createUTCDate`).

- **`src/utils.test.currency.js`** (~200 lines)
  - Contains tests for all functions now residing in `utils.currency.js`:
    - `parseCurrency`
    - `formatCurrencyForInput`
    - `formatCurrencyForDisplay`
    - (Add tests for `formatCurrencyForInputWithCommas` if not already present).
  - Import functions from `./utils.currency.js`.
  - Include necessary `vitest` imports and helper functions (like `extractText`, `checkClass`).

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Important:** First, ensure the Vitest configuration in `vitest.config.js` recognizes the new test file naming pattern by adding `'**/*.test.*.js'` to the include array if not already done in previous tasks:
   ```javascript
   include: [
     '**/*.test.js',
     '**/*.test.*.js'
   ],
   ```
2. Create the new files: `utils.test.date.js`, `utils.test.currency.js`.
3. Copy necessary imports (`vitest` functions, helper functions) into both new files.
4. Move the `describe` blocks related to date functions (as listed above) from `utils.test.js` into `utils.test.date.js`. Update the import statements at the top to pull from `./utils.date.js`.
5. Move the `describe` blocks related to currency functions (as listed above) from `utils.test.js` into `utils.test.currency.js`. Update the import statements at the top to pull from `./utils.currency.js`.
6. Run tests to verify each new file works correctly: `npx vitest run` (avoid using file paths with spaces in the command).
7. After confirming all tests pass, delete the original `utils.test.js` file.
8. Run tests again to ensure everything still works after removing the original file.

## Potential Issues and Solutions

- **Test file pattern recognition:** Vitest by default only recognizes `*.test.js` files. Make sure the configuration is updated as noted above.
- **Running specific test files:** When running specific test files, use proper escaping for spaces in file paths or use the pattern matching in the Vitest configuration.
- **Helper functions:** Make sure any helper functions used in the tests (like `createUTCDate` for date tests or DOM-related helpers for currency tests) are copied to the appropriate new test files.
- **Console warnings:** Some tests may intentionally trigger console warnings, especially for date parsing tests. These are expected and part of the test coverage.
- **Missing imports:** Make sure all necessary imports are included in each new file, especially any helper functions used in the tests.
- **Test dependencies:** Some tests might depend on utility functions from both date and currency modules. In such cases, import the necessary functions from both modules.

## Acceptance Criteria

- `utils.test.js` is removed.
- `utils.test.date.js` and `utils.test.currency.js` are created.
- `utils.test.date.js` contains tests only for functions in `utils.date.js`.
- `utils.test.currency.js` contains tests only for functions in `utils.currency.js`.
- Each new file is around 200-300 lines.
- Vitest configuration is updated to recognize the new test file naming pattern.
- All tests previously in `utils.test.js` are now in the new files, import from the correct source files, and pass successfully.
- No test failures or unexpected console errors after the refactoring.
