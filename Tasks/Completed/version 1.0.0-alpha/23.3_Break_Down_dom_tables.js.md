# Task 23.3: Break Down dom/tables.js

## Objective
Break down the `BC COIA calculator/dom/tables.js` file (currently 407 lines) into smaller, more focused files, each around 200 lines.

## Background
`dom/tables.js` contains functions specifically for updating the different tables (Interest and Summary) in the calculator's UI. Separating these functions based on the table they manage will improve clarity and maintainability within the `dom` module.

## File to Break Down
- `BC COIA calculator/dom/tables.js` (407 lines)

## Proposed New Files

Split into 2 files:
- **`BC COIA calculator/dom/tables.interest.js`** (~200 lines)
  - Contains the `updateInterestTable` function.
  - Include necessary imports (utils, elements, specialDamages helpers).
  - Export `updateInterestTable`.

- **`BC COIA calculator/dom/tables.summary.js`** (~210 lines)
  - Contains the `updateSummaryTable` function.
  - Contains the `clearResults` function (as it primarily clears table content).
  - Include necessary imports (utils, elements, setup helpers, store).
  - Export `updateSummaryTable` and `clearResults`.

## Implementation Strategy

1. Create the new files: `dom/tables.interest.js`, `dom/tables.summary.js`.
2. Move the `updateInterestTable` function and its related imports into `dom/tables.interest.js`. Add `export { updateInterestTable };`.
3. Move the `updateSummaryTable` and `clearResults` functions and their related imports into `dom/tables.summary.js`. Add `export { updateSummaryTable, clearResults };`.
4. Update files that previously imported from `dom/tables.js` (likely `calculator.ui.js` after Task 23.2, or `calculator.js` if Task 23.2 is not done yet, and potentially `domUtils.js` if it re-exports) to import the specific functions from the new files (`dom/tables.interest.js` and `dom/tables.summary.js`).
5. Test the application thoroughly:
   - Open the application in a browser and verify all table updates work correctly
   - Check that interest tables are populated with the correct data
   - Verify the summary table shows the correct totals
   - Test the clear results functionality
   - Check for console errors
6. After confirming the application works correctly, delete the original `dom/tables.js` file.
7. Test the application again after removing the original file to ensure everything still works.

## Potential Issues and Solutions

- **Missing dependencies**: Ensure all necessary imports are included in each new file. Look for helper functions or constants that might be used by the functions you're moving.
- **DOM element references**: Make sure any DOM element references are correctly imported from the elements.js file or other appropriate sources.
- **Function dependencies**: Check if any of the functions you're moving depend on other functions in the original file, and ensure those dependencies are properly handled.
- **Re-exports in other files**: If any other files re-export functions from `dom/tables.js`, update those re-exports to point to the new files.
- **Console errors**: Pay attention to any console errors that might indicate missing functions or incorrect imports.

## Acceptance Criteria

- `dom/tables.js` is removed.
- `dom/tables.interest.js` and `dom/tables.summary.js` are created.
- `dom/tables.interest.js` contains the logic for updating the prejudgment and postjudgment interest tables.
- `dom/tables.summary.js` contains the logic for updating the summary table and clearing results.
- Each new file is around 200 lines.
- Imports in other files are updated to point to the new modules.
- The application's table rendering and clearing functionality works as before.
- No console errors related to the refactoring.
- All table-related functionality continues to work correctly in the application.
