# Task 33.4: Implement State Restoration for Prejudgment Date

## Current Issue

After implementing Task 33.3 to save the prejudgment date when toggling the checkbox off, we need to ensure the date is properly restored when toggling the checkbox back on. Currently, the `restorePrejudgmentState()` function only restores calculation results if special damages exist.

## Objective

Enhance the `restorePrejudgmentState()` function in `store.js` to restore the prejudgment date regardless of whether there are special damages, and improve the state restoration logic to handle both inputs and results.

## Implementation Steps

1. Open `BC COIA calculator/store.js`

2. Modify the `restorePrejudgmentState()` function to restore the prejudgment date:

```javascript
/**
 * Restores the saved prejudgment calculation state
 * Used when toggling the prejudgment checkbox on
 */
restorePrejudgmentState: () => set((state) => {
    // Check if we have any saved state
    if (state.savedPrejudgmentState) {
        // First, prepare to update inputs
        const inputUpdates = {};
        
        // Always restore the prejudgment date if it exists
        if (state.savedPrejudgmentState.prejudgmentStartDate) {
            inputUpdates.prejudgmentStartDate = state.savedPrejudgmentState.prejudgmentStartDate;
        }
        
        // Check if we have special damages to restore
        const hasSpecialDamages = state.savedPrejudgmentState.specialDamages && 
                                 state.savedPrejudgmentState.specialDamages.length > 0;
        
        // If we have special damages, restore both inputs and results
        if (hasSpecialDamages) {
            return {
                inputs: {
                    ...state.inputs,
                    ...inputUpdates
                },
                results: {
                    ...state.results,
                    specialDamages: [...state.savedPrejudgmentState.specialDamages],
                    specialDamagesTotal: state.savedPrejudgmentState.specialDamages.reduce(
                        (sum, damage) => sum + damage.amount, 0
                    ),
                    prejudgmentResult: {
                        ...state.savedPrejudgmentState.prejudgmentResult
                    }
                }
            };
        } else if (Object.keys(inputUpdates).length > 0) {
            // If no special damages but we have saved inputs, just restore those
            return {
                inputs: {
                    ...state.inputs,
                    ...inputUpdates
                }
            };
        }
    }
    return {}; // Return empty object if no saved state to restore
}),
```

## Key Changes

1. Enhanced restoration logic:
   - Added check for any saved state (`if (state.savedPrejudgmentState)`)
   - Created `inputUpdates` object to collect input values to restore
   - Added restoration of prejudgment date if it exists

2. Added conditional restoration logic:
   - Added check for special damages (`hasSpecialDamages`)
   - If special damages exist, restore both inputs and results
   - If no special damages but inputs exist, only restore inputs
   - If neither exists, return an empty object

3. Improved structure:
   - Updated to properly handle both scenarios (with/without special damages)
   - Ensures the prejudgment date is always restored if it exists

## Testing Procedure

1. Complete and verify Tasks 33.1, 33.2, and 33.3 first
2. Open the application in your browser using Live Server
3. Open the browser's developer console (F12 or right-click > Inspect > Console)
4. Enter a valid prejudgment interest date (e.g., "2024-04-20")
5. Perform the following tests:
   - Add a console log statement at the start of `restorePrejudgmentState()`:
     ```javascript
     console.log("Restoring prejudgment state with date:", state.savedPrejudgmentState?.prejudgmentStartDate);
     ```
   - Uncheck the "Show prejudgment interest" checkbox
   - Recheck the checkbox
   - Verify in the console that the date was restored
   - The prejudgment date input field should show the original date

6. Also test with special damages:
   - Add some special damages
   - Repeat the toggle test
   - Verify both the date and special damages are restored

## Expected Results

- When the prejudgment checkbox is toggled off and back on, the prejudgment date is correctly restored
- The date should appear in the input field exactly as it was before toggling
- The function should also maintain existing behavior of restoring special damages
- Console logs should confirm the date is being restored

## Dependencies

- This task builds on Tasks 33.1, 33.2, and 33.3
- This task is required for Task 33.5 (DOM Synchronization)
