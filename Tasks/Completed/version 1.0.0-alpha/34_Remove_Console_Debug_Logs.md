# Task 34: Remove Debug Console Logs

## Description
The console is currently being flooded with debug messages that were added during development but are no longer needed. These messages clutter the console and make it difficult to see any important warnings or errors that might occur during actual usage.

## Files to Modify
Based on the console output, the following files contain debug console logs that need to be removed:

1. `calculator.ui.js` - Initialization logging
2. `datepickers.js` - Datepicker state and initialization logs
3. `calculator.core.js` - Calculation step logging
4. `excerpt.js` - Connection and DOM logging
5. `visibility.js` - State saving/restoration logging
6. `store.js` - State management logging

## Example Console Output
```
calculator.ui.js:136 Initializing Calculator...
datepickers.js:44 Datepickers initialized. Visibility: {showPrejudgment: true, showPostjudgment: true, prejudgmentPickerCreated: false, postjudgmentPickerCreated: false}
calculator.core.js:275 Using calculated prejudgment interest: 248.36065573770492
calculator.core.js:284 Judgment total calculated: 10248.360655737704
calculator.core.js:368 Final total calculation:
calculator.core.js:369   Judgment total: 10248.360655737704
calculator.core.js:370   Postjudgment interest: 314.6967842579264
calculator.core.js:371   Total owing: 10563.057439995631
excerpt.js:2 container root created <div>​…​</div>​
visibility.js:108 Saving current prejudgment calculation state
store.js:208 Saved prejudgment state: {prejudgmentStartDate: Fri Apr 19 2024 17:00:00 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time), hasSpecialDamages: false}
visibility.js:113 Saving calculated prejudgment interest as user-entered value: 248.36065573770492
calculator.core.js:231 Prejudgment calculation skipped: Checkbox unchecked.
excerpt.js:2 Could not establish connection. Receiving end does not exist.
```

## Implementation Details
1. Review each file and remove all `console.log`, `console.debug`, `console.info` statements
2. Keep any essential `console.warn` or `console.error` statements that might be important for error reporting
3. Test the application thoroughly to ensure removing the logs doesn't affect functionality

## Benefits
- Cleaner browser console for end users
- Easier to spot actual errors and warnings
- Slightly improved performance (especially for extensive logging)
- More professional production code

## Testing Plan
After removing the console logs:
1. Verify the application still functions correctly
2. Check the browser console to confirm it's clean of debug messages
3. Ensure any intentional errors or warnings still appear appropriately
