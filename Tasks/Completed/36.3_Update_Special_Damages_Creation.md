# Task 36.3: Update Special Damages Creation

## Objective
Modify the special damages row creation process to use flatpickr for date inputs instead of the basic date input with manual validation.

## Requirements
1. Update the `insertSpecialDamagesRow` function in specialDamages.js to use flatpickr
2. Ensure proper initialization of the date picker with constraints
3. Verify the recalculation is properly triggered when dates change
4. Maintain all existing functionality of special damages rows

## Implementation Details

### 1. Update `insertSpecialDamagesRow` Function
- Modify the function to:
  - Create the date input as before
  - Replace `setupCustomDateInputListeners` with a call to the new `initializeSpecialDamagesDatePicker` function
  - Pass the appropriate recalculation callback

### 2. Handle Date Initialization
- Ensure the date input is pre-populated with the correct date
- Initialize the flatpickr instance with this date
- Apply the proper date constraints as implemented in Task 36.2

### 3. Integration with Recalculation
- Ensure the date picker's onChange handler properly triggers the special-damages-updated event
- Verify that the event listener for this event is still working correctly in calculator.ui.js

### 4. Styling and UI Consistency
- Ensure the flatpickr styling is consistent with other date pickers
- Verify that the date input appears and behaves consistently with other date inputs

## Acceptance Criteria
- Special damages rows created with the "add special damages" button use flatpickr for the date input
- The date picker is initialized with the correct date and constraints
- Changing the date properly triggers recalculation
- The UI is consistent with other date pickers in the application

## Test Approach
For manual testing:
1. Click "add special damages" on a regular period row
2. Verify the new row has a working flatpickr date picker
3. Verify the date constraints are applied correctly
4. Change the date and verify recalculation is triggered
5. Verify all other functionality of the special damages row works correctly
