# Task 33.7: End-to-End Testing and Integration - Implementation

## Changes Made

This task focused on implementing the necessary debug logging to facilitate end-to-end testing of the COI Calculator application, with a particular emphasis on lifecycle-aware datepickers and state preservation/restoration.

### 1. Enhanced Debug Logging in datepickers.js

Added comprehensive debug logging to the `initializeDatePickers()` function to track:
- Current visibility state of prejudgment and postjudgment sections
- Whether datepickers are being created for these sections
- The state of datepicker instances before and after initialization

```javascript
// Debug logging for lifecycle events
console.log("Datepickers initialized. Visibility:", {
    showPrejudgment: useStore.getState().inputs.showPrejudgment,
    showPostjudgment: useStore.getState().inputs.showPostjudgment,
    prejudgmentPickerCreated: !!prejudgmentDatePicker,
    postjudgmentPickerCreated: !!postjudgmentDatePicker
});
```

This logging helps verify that datepickers are only created for visible elements and are properly destroyed when elements become hidden.

### 2. Enhanced Debug Logging in store.js

Improved the debug logging in the state preservation and restoration functions:

#### In savePrejudgmentState():
```javascript
console.log("Saved prejudgment state:", {
    prejudgmentStartDate: state.inputs.prejudgmentStartDate,
    hasSpecialDamages: state.results.specialDamages.length > 0
});
```

#### In restorePrejudgmentState():
```javascript
console.log("Restored prejudgment state:", {
    prejudgmentStartDate: state.savedPrejudgmentState?.prejudgmentStartDate,
    hasSpecialDamages: state.savedPrejudgmentState?.specialDamages?.length > 0
});
```

These enhancements provide more structured and detailed information about what's being saved and restored, making it easier to track the state preservation and restoration process during testing.

### 3. Created End-to-End Testing Plan

Developed a comprehensive testing plan (`end-to-end-testing-plan.md`) that outlines:
- Prerequisites for testing
- Detailed testing procedures for various aspects of the application
- A final verification workflow
- Templates for recording test results and issues

The testing plan covers:
1. Basic functionality tests for datepicker initialization and constraints
2. State preservation and restoration tests
3. DOM synchronization tests
4. Validation tests for hidden elements
5. Edge case tests for various scenarios

## How to Use

1. Open the application in a browser with the console open
2. Follow the testing procedures outlined in `end-to-end-testing-plan.md`
3. Use the console logs to verify that:
   - Datepickers are properly initialized based on visibility
   - State is correctly saved when toggling prejudgment checkbox off
   - State is correctly restored when toggling prejudgment checkbox on
4. Record any issues found during testing in the "Issues Found" section of the testing plan

## Expected Results

With the enhanced debug logging in place, testers should be able to:
- Confirm that datepickers are only created for visible elements
- Verify that state is properly preserved and restored when toggling visibility
- Ensure that DOM is synchronized with the store state
- Validate that validation only applies to visible elements
- Confirm that the application behaves consistently across all test scenarios

## Next Steps

After completing the testing:
1. Address any issues found during testing
2. Consider adding additional debug logging if needed for specific areas
3. Document any edge cases or unexpected behaviors for future reference
