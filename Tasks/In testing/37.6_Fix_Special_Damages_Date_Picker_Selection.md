# Subtask 37.6: Fix Special Damages Date Picker Selection - COMPLETE

## Goal

Fix the issue where selecting a date from the special damages date picker calendar does not update the input field value, even though the date picker shows the correct constraints.

## Background

During implementation of Task 37.5 (Edge Case Handling and Cleanup), we identified that while special damages datepickers are correctly initialized with appropriate constraints (dates between prejudgment date + 1 day and judgment date), selecting a date in the calendar widget didn't update the input field's value. Manual typing still worked correctly.

## Implementation Summary

The issue was resolved by addressing two key problems in the implementation:

1. The direct input value updates were implemented correctly, but were being interfered with by custom date input handlers
2. Our code had duelling input handlers - flatpickr and our custom date input handlers were both trying to manage the input

### Changes Made:

1. **Modified `onSpecialDamagesDateChange` in dom/datepickers.js**:
   - Removed the indirect data attribute approach (`dataset.selectedDate`) 
   - Added direct input value updates for valid dates: `inputElement.value = formattedDate;`
   - Added proper change event dispatching to ensure DOM state synchronization

2. **Updated both insert functions in dom/specialDamages.js**:
   - Removed the code that checked for and processed `dataset.selectedDate`
   - **IMPORTANT FIX**: Removed the `setupCustomDateInputListeners` calls for all special damages date inputs
   - Let flatpickr fully handle the date input behavior without interference

### Key Issue Found:
The main problem was having two competing systems for handling date inputs:
1. Flatpickr (which worked for the main date fields)
2. Custom input listeners which were interfering with flatpickr's updates

### Before Fix:
```javascript
// In onSpecialDamagesDateChange - using indirect data attribute approach
if (newDate) {
    inputElement.dataset.selectedDate = formattedDate;
}
```

```javascript
// In specialDamages.js - causing the interference
initializeSpecialDamagesDatePicker(dateInput, function() {
    // Checking for data attribute
    if (dateInput.dataset.selectedDate) {
        dateInput.value = dateInput.dataset.selectedDate;
        delete dateInput.dataset.selectedDate;
    }
    // ...
});

// Also adding competing event handlers
setupCustomDateInputListeners(dateInput, function() {
    // ...
});
```

### After Fix:
```javascript
// In onSpecialDamagesDateChange - direct update
if (newDate) {
    inputElement.value = formattedDate;
    const changeEvent = new Event('change', { bubbles: true });
    inputElement.dispatchEvent(changeEvent);
}
```

```javascript
// In specialDamages.js - let flatpickr fully handle the date input
initializeSpecialDamagesDatePicker(dateInput, function() {
    // When the date changes, trigger recalculation
    const event = new CustomEvent('special-damages-updated');
    document.dispatchEvent(event);
});

// No more setupCustomDateInputListeners - removing the interference
```

## Testing Performed
- Verified selecting dates from the datepicker now updates the input field value
- Verified date constraints still work correctly (special damages dates must be between prejudgment date + 1 day and judgment date)
- Verified that multiple special damages rows all handle date selection correctly
- Confirmed that calculations update properly when dates are selected

## Notes
The issue was caused by having two competing systems for handling date inputs. This fix ensures flatpickr can fully manage the special damages date inputs without interference. It aligns the implementation with how the main date fields work, which were already functioning correctly.
