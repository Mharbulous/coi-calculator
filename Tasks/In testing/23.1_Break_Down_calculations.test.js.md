# Task 23.1: Break Down calculations.test.js

## Objective
Break down the `BC COIA calculator/calculations.test.js` file (currently 623 lines) into smaller, more focused test files, each around 200 lines.

## Background
`calculations.test.js` contains tests for multiple functions within `calculations.js`. Splitting these tests into separate files based on the function being tested will improve organization and maintainability.

## File to Break Down
- `BC COIA calculator/calculations.test.js` (623 lines)

## Proposed New Files

Split into 3 files:
- **`BC COIA calculator/calculations.test.rate.js`** (~210 lines)
  - Contains tests for `getInterestRateForDate`.
  - Include necessary mock data setup and helper functions.
  - Include basic test utilities.

- **`BC COIA calculator/calculations.test.periods.js`** (~250 lines)
  - Contains tests for `calculateInterestPeriods`.
  - Include necessary mock data setup and helper functions.

- **`BC COIA calculator/calculations.test.perdiem.js`** (~200 lines)
  - Contains tests for `calculatePerDiem`.
  - Include necessary mock data setup and helper functions.

## Implementation Strategy

1. Create the new files: `calculations.test.rate.js`, `calculations.test.periods.js`, `calculations.test.perdiem.js`.
2. Move the relevant `describe` blocks and tests for each function (`getInterestRateForDate`, `calculateInterestPeriods`, `calculatePerDiem`) into the corresponding new file.
3. Copy all necessary setup code (mock data, helper functions like `createUTCDate`, `expectToBeCloseTo`) into each new file. Each file should be self-contained rather than sharing helpers across files to avoid dependencies.
4. Update imports/exports as needed.
5. **Important:** Update the Vitest configuration in `vitest.config.js` to recognize the new test file naming pattern by adding `'**/*.test.*.js'` to the include array:
   ```javascript
   include: [
     '**/*.test.js',
     '**/*.test.*.js'
   ],
   ```
6. Run tests to verify each new file works correctly: `npx vitest run` (avoid using file paths with spaces in the command).
7. After confirming all tests pass, delete the original `calculations.test.js` file.
8. Run tests again to ensure everything still works after removing the original file.

## Potential Issues and Solutions

- **Test file pattern recognition:** Vitest by default only recognizes `*.test.js` files. Make sure to update the configuration as noted above.
- **Running specific test files:** When running specific test files, use proper escaping for spaces in file paths or use the pattern matching in the Vitest configuration.
- **Duplicate mock data:** Each test file will contain its own copy of the mock data and helper functions. This duplication is acceptable to keep files independent.
- **Console warnings:** Some tests intentionally trigger console warnings. These are expected and part of the test coverage.

## Acceptance Criteria

- `calculations.test.js` is removed.
- `calculations.test.rate.js`, `calculations.test.periods.js`, and `calculations.test.perdiem.js` are created.
- Each new test file is focused on a specific function from `calculations.js`.
- Each new file is around 200 lines (adjusting slightly as needed for logical grouping).
- Vitest configuration is updated to recognize the new test file naming pattern.
- All tests previously in `calculations.test.js` are now in the new files and pass successfully.
- The application functions exactly as before.
