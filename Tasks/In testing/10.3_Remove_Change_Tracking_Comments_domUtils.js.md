# 10.3 Remove Change Tracking Comments from domUtils.js

## Context

As part of the broader effort to clean up the codebase by removing change tracking comments (Task 10), this subtask focuses specifically on the `domUtils.js` file in the BC COIA calculator directory.

The file currently contains change tracking comments that document historical modifications to the code. These comments include markers like `// Removed` that reference elements that have been moved elsewhere or are no longer needed.

## Goal

Clean up the `domUtils.js` file by removing all change tracking comments while preserving meaningful documentation. This will improve code readability and maintainability without losing important context.

## What to Keep vs. Remove

### Remove:
- Comments that track historical changes, such as:
  - `// Removed the early return check for dynamic inputs.`
  - Any other comments that primarily track historical changes rather than explain functionality

### Keep:
- JSDoc comments (`/** ... */`) that document function parameters and return values
- Section headers (`// --- ... ---`) that organize the code
- Explanatory comments that clarify logic or implementation details
- Comments that explain "why" certain approaches were taken

## File Location

`BC COIA calculator/domUtils.js`

## Benefits

1. **Improved Readability**: Code will be cleaner and easier to understand
2. **Better Maintainability**: Developers can focus on current functionality rather than historical changes
3. **Reduced Clutter**: Removing unnecessary comments reduces file size and cognitive load
4. **Proper Use of Version Control**: Relies on Git for tracking historical changes, as intended

## Approach

1. Examine the `domUtils.js` file for change tracking comments
2. Carefully remove these comments while preserving meaningful documentation
3. Test the application after changes to ensure no functional code was accidentally modified

## Completion Criteria

- All change tracking comments have been removed from the `domUtils.js` file
- All meaningful documentation has been preserved
- The application functions correctly after the changes
- Code review confirms the cleanup was thorough and appropriate
