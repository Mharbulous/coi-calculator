# Task 1.7: Document the Firebase Setup

## Overview
This subtask involves creating comprehensive documentation for the Firebase setup completed in the previous subtasks. Good documentation is crucial for future developers to understand the infrastructure, security considerations, and design decisions.

## Complexity
Simple

## Estimated Time
30 minutes

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Create Project Setup Documentation
1. Create a file `firebase-setup.md` in the project root or documentation directory
2. Document the following aspects of the Firebase project:
   - Project name and ID
   - Firebase services enabled (Firestore, Authentication)
   - Region/location settings
   - Web app registration details
   - Access control mechanisms

### 2. Document Database Schema
1. Add a section describing the Firestore database schema:
   ```
   interestRates (collection)
   |
   ├── BC (document)
   |   └── rates (array)
   |       ├── { start: "1993-01-01", prejudgment: 5.25, postjudgment: 7.25 }
   |       ├── { start: "1993-07-01", prejudgment: 4.00, postjudgment: 6.00 }
   |       └── ...additional rates
   |
   ├── metadata (document)
   |   ├── lastUpdated: "2025-04-19"
   |   └── validUntil: "2025-06-30"
   |
   └── ... other jurisdictions
   ```
2. Include data types, field constraints, and indexing considerations
3. Document any specific query patterns that influenced the schema design

### 3. Document Security Rules
1. Add a section explaining the security rules:
   - Current development rules
   - Planned production rules
   - Authentication requirements
   - Access control strategy

### 4. Document Integration Points
1. Explain how Firebase connects to the application:
   - Location of the firebase-config.js file
   - How interest rates are fetched
   - Caching mechanism
   - Error handling approach

### 5. Create Maintenance Guide
1. Add instructions for:
   - Adding new jurisdictions
   - Updating interest rates
   - Backup procedures
   - Monitoring and logging

## Testing Steps
1. Review the documentation for accuracy and completeness
2. Have another team member review the documentation if possible
3. Verify all links and references are correct

## Expected Outcome
By the end of this subtask, you should have:
1. Comprehensive documentation of the Firebase setup
2. Clear explanation of the database schema and security rules
3. Instructions for ongoing maintenance and updates
4. A reference document for future developers

## Notes
- Include screenshots where helpful
- Avoid including sensitive information like API keys in the documentation
- Consider using markdown format for better readability and version control
- Document known limitations or issues that need to be addressed in future updates
