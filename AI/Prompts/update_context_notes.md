Review the currently open context_notes file (a file from AI\Context\ folder that is currently open) to help you understand aspects of the code that will be important for the task that you are about to work on.  Start by reviewing the codebase to confirm that the information contained in the recently opened context_notes file is to date and not describing a previous state of the code. If the context notes are accurate and up to date then say so, and if not, and if not, describe how it needs to be updated.
