Please reflect on what context information about the current implementation was important to understanding and completing the work. Create a markdown file in the /AI/Context/ folder with notes about non-obvious or important aspects and context details related to the coding task that you just completed. 

In the markdown file:
1. Include context information that wasn't initially obvious but was discovered during the task
2. Document architectural patterns and relationships that affect this code
3. Highlight potential pitfalls and edge cases to be aware of
4. Explain how this component interacts with other parts of the system
5. Note any specific testing considerations or requirements

Give the file an appropriate name like "[system]_[component]_context.md", and include an introduction paragraph that describes the kinds of tasks where reviewing this context file would be beneficial before making changes.

The goal is to capture institutional knowledge that will help future developers (including yourself) work more efficiently with this code.
