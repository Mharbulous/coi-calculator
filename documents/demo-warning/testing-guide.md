# Testing Guide for Print Warning Fix

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Paid User Experience
1. Ensure you're in paid mode (verified by the "Using verified court order interest rates" indicator at the top)
2. Try printing the document in various ways:
   - Click the "Print" button in the app
   - Use browser's print function (Ctrl+P or browser menu)
   - Use system's print dialog shortcut
3. Verify the print preview does NOT show the "DEMONSTRATION MODE WARNING" in any case

### Scenario 2: Unpaid User Experience
1. Ensure you're in demo mode (verified by the "DEMONSTRATION" watermark)
2. Click the "Print" button in the app
3. Verify the demo modal appears with three options
4. Choose "Dismiss" and verify no printing occurs
5. Click "Print" again, then choose "Test Print"
6. Verify the print preview temporarily hides the warning
7. Click "Print" again, then choose "Buy Now"
8. Verify you're redirected to the payment page

### Scenario 3: Direct Browser Print (Unpaid User)
1. Ensure you're in demo mode
2. Use the browser's print function directly (Ctrl+P or browser menu)
3. Verify the print preview DOES show the "DEMONSTRATION MODE WARNING"

### Scenario 4: Mode Transitions
1. Start in paid mode
2. Use "Reset to Demo Mode" if in test mode (or clear localStorage)
3. Verify the warning appears in print preview
4. Switch back to paid mode
5. Verify the warning does NOT appear in print preview

## Verification Checklist
- [ ] Print warning is completely hidden for paid users in all print methods
- [ ] Print warning is visible for unpaid users by default
- [ ] Print warning can be temporarily hidden using the "Test Print" option
- [ ] Mode transitions properly update the warning visibility

## Testing Notes
- This fix handles direct browser print operations as well as app-triggered prints
- There's no need for paid users to use the "Test Print" function as it does the same thing as regular print
- The fix is robust against page refreshes and browser restarts (relies on localStorage)
