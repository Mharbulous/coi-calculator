# Demo Warning in Paid Mode - Issue & Solution

## Problem
The "DEMONSTRATION MODE WARNING" modal is appearing on the printed version of the app even when the user has already paid.

## Root Cause Analysis

Looking at the current implementation in `demo-mode.js`, there's an issue with how the print warning is managed:

1. The warning element (`#print-warning`) is always present in the HTML for both paid and unpaid users
2. The warning is hidden by default on screen but visible in print via CSS (`@media print`)
3. It's only hidden in print when the element has the `hide-for-print` class
4. For paid users, we weren't adding this class during initialization, so it was showing up in print

## Solution

The solution follows the proper workflow for handling the print warning:

1. During initialization:
   - Check if the user has paid
   - If they have paid, immediately add the `hide-for-print` class to the warning element
   - This ensures the warning is hidden for ALL print operations

2. For print operations:
   - Paid users: Print directly (warning is already hidden)
   - Unpaid users: Show the demo modal, only hide warning temporarily if they click "Test Print"

## Implementation Changes

1. Added code to `initializeDemoMode` function:
   ```javascript
   if (isPaid) {
     // Show a small indicator that real rates are being used
     addPaidModeIndicator();
     
     // Hide print warning permanently for paid users
     const printWarning = document.getElementById('print-warning');
     if (printWarning) printWarning.classList.add('hide-for-print');
   }
   ```

2. Simplified the `handlePrintClick` function for paid users:
   ```javascript
   if (isPaid) {
     // In paid mode, just print directly
     // The warning already has hide-for-print class added during initialization
     window.print();
   }
   ```

This approach is more reliable because:
1. It handles the warning visibility at initialization time
2. It works with ALL print operations (browser print menu, Print button click)
3. It's consistent with the app's pattern of setting up different UI elements based on payment status
