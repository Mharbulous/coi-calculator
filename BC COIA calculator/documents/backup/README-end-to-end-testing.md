# End-to-End Testing for COI Calculator

## Overview

This document provides an overview of the end-to-end testing implementation for the Court Order Interest (COI) Calculator application. The testing focuses on ensuring that all components work together correctly, with particular emphasis on lifecycle-aware datepickers, state preservation/restoration, and validation logic.

## Files Modified

1. **datepickers.js**
   - Added debug logging to track datepicker initialization and visibility state
   - Helps verify that datepickers are only created for visible elements

2. **store.js**
   - Enhanced debug logging in state preservation and restoration functions
   - Provides detailed information about what's being saved and restored during toggle operations

## Testing Documentation

1. **end-to-end-testing-plan.md**
   - Comprehensive testing plan with detailed procedures
   - Covers basic functionality, state preservation, DOM synchronization, validation, and edge cases
   - Includes a final verification workflow and templates for recording results

2. **Tasks/Completed/33.7_End_To_End_Testing_And_Integration.md**
   - Documents the implementation details of the testing enhancements
   - Explains the purpose and expected outcomes of the debug logging

## Testing Focus Areas

The end-to-end testing focuses on several key aspects of the application:

1. **Lifecycle-Aware Datepickers**
   - Verifying datepickers are only created for visible elements
   - Ensuring proper destruction and recreation when visibility changes

2. **State Preservation and Restoration**
   - Confirming that state (dates, special damages) is properly saved when toggling visibility off
   - Verifying that state is correctly restored when toggling visibility back on

3. **DOM Synchronization**
   - Ensuring the DOM accurately reflects the application state
   - Verifying that input fields show correct values after state restoration

4. **Validation Logic**
   - Confirming that validation only applies to visible elements
   - Verifying error messages are clear and specific

5. **Edge Cases**
   - Testing rapid toggling of visibility
   - Verifying behavior with mixed visibility settings
   - Ensuring proper error recovery

## How to Run Tests

1. Open the application in a browser with the developer console open
2. Follow the procedures outlined in `end-to-end-testing-plan.md`
3. Use the console logs to verify expected behavior
4. Record any issues found during testing

## Debug Logging

The added debug logging provides visibility into:

- Current visibility state of prejudgment and postjudgment sections
- Whether datepickers are being created for these sections
- What state is being saved when toggling prejudgment off
- What state is being restored when toggling prejudgment on

Example console output:

```
Datepickers initialized. Visibility: {showPrejudgment: true, showPostjudgment: true, prejudgmentPickerCreated: false, postjudgmentPickerCreated: false}
Saved prejudgment state: {prejudgmentStartDate: Wed Jan 15 2024 00:00:00 GMT-0800 (Pacific Standard Time), hasSpecialDamages: true}
Restored prejudgment state: {prejudgmentStartDate: Wed Jan 15 2024 00:00:00 GMT-0800 (Pacific Standard Time), hasSpecialDamages: true}
```

## Conclusion

The end-to-end testing implementation provides a structured approach to verifying that all components of the COI Calculator work together correctly. By focusing on key areas such as lifecycle-aware datepickers, state preservation/restoration, and validation logic, the testing helps ensure a robust and reliable application.
