# Task 37.3: Handle Special Damages Persistence - Implementation Notes

## Changes Made

1. **Fixed Critical Bug in Special Damages Collection Logic**
   - Fixed a bug in `collectSpecialDamages()` function that was overwriting default special damages
   - Modified logic to preserve default special damages in the store when no rows are found in the DOM
   - Added conditional flow that only updates the store when special damages are found in the DOM
   - Implemented protection to prevent losing default special damages during initial rendering

2. **Enhanced Debug Logging for Persistence Tracking**
   - Added detailed logging in `visibility.js` to track special damages when prejudgment interest is toggled on/off
   - Added logging in `calculator.core.js` to track when saved special damages are used during calculations
   - Added logging in `tables.interest.js` to track special damages loading from DOM vs. store

3. **Test Automation Script**
   - Created `test-special-damages-persistence.js` for manual testing of special damages persistence
   - Test script verifies each step of the process:
     - Saving special damages when prejudgment is toggled off
     - Restoring special damages when prejudgment is toggled on
     - Verifying DOM rendering of restored special damages

## Implementation Details

The special damages persistence mechanism relies on three main components:

1. **State Preservation**
   - When prejudgment is toggled off, `savePrejudgmentState()` saves the current special damages array
   - The special damages are stored in the `savedPrejudgmentState` property of the store

2. **State Restoration**
   - When prejudgment is toggled on, `restorePrejudgmentState()` restores the special damages
   - The special damages are copied from `savedPrejudgmentState` back to the results

3. **DOM Rendering**
   - After restoration, the `updateInterestTable()` function renders special damages to the DOM
   - If no special damages are found in the DOM, it retrieves them from the store

## Testing

To test the implementation:
1. Load the application with the default special damages
2. Toggle the prejudgment interest checkbox off
3. Toggle the prejudgment interest checkbox back on
4. Verify that special damages are still displayed in the prejudgment table

Alternatively, load the page and run `testSpecialDamagesPersistence()` from the browser console to execute the automated test sequence.

## Validation

- Special damages should persist when toggling prejudgment interest off and on
- Special damages should be properly sorted by date after restoration
- New special damages can be added alongside default ones
- Deleting a special damage row should not affect other rows during toggle
